<p><span class="smcap">The great</span> mental suffering which the Nazis created in me with their
murder factories, their atrocious robbing and sadistic killing of
defenseless innocents, and their unprecedented merciless wars against
guiltless nations, spontaneously prompted me to write this book.</p>

<p>I am not writing it for personal gain, neither have I an ax to grind.
It is a message to humanity, purely a labor of love, hoping to finish
and have it ready before I die.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the last half century, I was a part of our
economic system as a small financial speculator, investor, business
man, executive, and employer. Experienced success, failure, profits,
and losses, have traveled a great deal and always have been a keen
observer and reader.</p>

<p>I am not trying to set myself up as an authority on world subjects
and affairs, but I feel qualified by my experiences to help humanity.
Have no personal prejudice, nor feel inimical to the present way of
life, and economic and political powers of our country. My aim is to
show mankind, in my own way, and with humility, its defective economic
system of living.</p>

<p>Mankind has been looking forward for the millennium, when there will
be peace, and security on earth. For a long time I have with undue
anxiety been deeply reflecting to find out and analyze the fundamental
principle contributing to our world turmoil. Have arrived at the cause,
and maybe at the solution, in my following treatise.</p>

<p>Am not superstitious nor ultrareligious, but most of my inspiration
in the writing of this book came from impulses given to me by some
power other than my own. I seem to have been impelled by a supernatural
intervention.</p>

<p>Many another author before me has tried to show humanity the error of
its ways. But even that does not deter me from trying to make clear to
mankind my conception of how unjust has been our way of living.</p>

<p>Mankind as a whole would be humane if it were not for the false system
that our ancestors have created and planted in our world.</p>

<p>Man with his intelligence has two personalities. He is by nature on one
side humane, helpful, unselfish and self sacrificing, interested in the
welfare of his kind. On the other side, because of our economic system,
he has become in many ways a selfish, cruel, and a predatory animal.</p>

<p>I am going to picture as clearly as possible existing faults of our way
of living and am suggesting an imaginary remedy. I am fully convinced
that it is not only a workable plan, but it is the only solution and
antidote we have.</p>

<p>My objective is to help bring about, by my humble efforts, a gradual
evolution, believing it possible to work toward a sane and balanced
economic life without creating social unrest or strife.</p>

the scrupulous, good workmanlike manner she typed and retyped my

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><i>Our Coming World</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">On my daily</span> afternoon strolls on West Riverside Drive Parkway, between
85th and 87th Streets in New York, I noticed a young man about thirty
years old sitting alone, always on the same bench, for long periods
looking up into the sky or fumbling in his brief case and reading
his diary and papers. Most of the time he seemed to me to be in a
disconsolate mood.</p>

<p>I sat down beside him, but his manner did not encourage conversation.
Every day afterward I sat down on the bench near him and finally, with
a great deal of tact, I began to talk to him. He gradually seemed to
gain confidence in me. After a couple of weeks of daily meetings I felt
by his actions that he was looking forward to my presence each day.</p>

<p>One day, seeming to feel somewhat communicative he apologized for his
former rudeness and said, "My name is Fred Balmore. I'm reticent but
it isn't because I don't like to talk to strangers. On the contrary,
I would only be too glad to tell anyone my story who would help and
believe me. My parents, my lifelong friends, the National Geographic
Society, everyone hearing or reading my story seem to think I am
insane. But somehow, I feel you'll understand.</p>

<p>"My parents had me examined by alienists and I was confined for a short
time in an insane asylum in an effort to cure my—," the young man
hesitated for a moment, "what they called my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span> delusions. I am sure if I
tell you my story, you'll have a hard time believing me too.</p>

<p>"I have inherited a large amount of money. The executors of my
grandfather's estate stopped my allowance because they think I'm not
mentally responsible. I am anxious to purchase an aeroplane, but my
pilot's license has been revoked. I went to a government airfield and,
without permission, jumped into one of the bombers standing idle;
before I had a chance to take it off the ground, I was caught, forcibly
removed, and sent to an insane asylum."</p>

<p>I asked him why he had been so rash and he answered, "When you hear my
story, you will understand my purpose.</p>

<p>"By the way, my superior in the air corps also has the idea I am
insane. He believes we cracked up somewhere and that I in some manner
was saved, and so reported it to the War Department, who officially
notified families of my crew members of their death."</p>

<p>His intelligent conversation and calm demeanor convinced me of his
sanity. He was obviously anxious to explain and justify his actions to
me. As a writer I was naturally interested. I encouraged him to tell
his strange story which follows.</p>

<p>"Before entering the army I had just graduated from a well-known
eastern college, with a degree in journalism. I became very adept in
taking down notes and lectures in shorthand. This was to be a great
help to me afterward.</p>

<p>"I am a Lieutenant in the air force, and was the pilot of one of our
latest and largest B-29 bombers—never mind its number. The government
might not want me to tell my story but my conscience is clear. I feel
free to tell you what happened to me, as there are no military secrets
involved. You say you are an author. I am sure you will be very much
interested and perhaps you will write and publish my story."</p>

<p>Taking from his brief case a bulky typewritten diary he gave it to
me to read. That evening I settled into a comfortable chair with no
inkling of what this diary would mean to me. This is what I read:</p>

<p>On a day known to only a few, I was ordered to prepare my ship for
flight early the following morning. Ten educated boys of excellent
background had been chosen for my crew. Each was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span> able to speak another
language beside English. Their families had come from various European
countries. I, with my crew, was to take this ship, fly it over the
Pacific, deliver it to the command on one of our airfields in Japan and
wait there for further instructions. I was given a supply of silver
dollars and five dollar gold pieces to use, if by accident we should
land in Asia among the Asiatic tribes.</p>

<p>Early on the appointed day, fully equipped with oxygen tanks, breathing
pressure suits and ammunition, with our guns ready for action and our
instruments, including the secret mechanism in our radio transmitter in
good order, we took off. We flew fast, upward to the highest possible
altitude of the stratosphere, to make a speedy passage across.</p>

<p>After flying rapidly and smoothly for some time, when we were at about
the middle of the Pacific, we suddenly felt our ship was being pulled
higher and higher from the earth into and above the atmosphere. Our
altimeter without reason was fast rising. We could not understand why
such a phenomenon.</p>

<p>Looking up, we perceived an immensely large plane of a very strange
design, nearly twenty times larger than our own. Hovering in the
distance right over us, it covered us like a large, dark cloud.</p>

<p>Too far away to get any help, and thinking that this was a new kind
of enemy plane, we, according to orders, destroyed certain secret
mechanisms including our high frequency radio transmitter. Then, we
used all the force of our powerful motors in an attempt at a nose dive.
But even with the strong gravitational pull of the earth, we could not
shake ourselves loose from the upward attraction. I ordered our guns
manned to shoot it out. But a loud voice called out to us to desist,
that this was not an enemy plane. At the same time, all our motors and
instruments stopped, and we ourselves became as if paralyzed.</p>

<p>We were fully conscious. We could hear, talk, think, see. We could
feel our ship was gradually being pulled up to this plane, and finally
absorbed into her through a large opening in her belly. Our plane was
anchored within. Then a voice, calling me by rank and name in perfect
English, told me that our captors were going to free our bodies from
the paralyzing rays and that we would suffer no aftereffects. We
immediately regained our power of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span> motion. The same voice ordered us
to come out of our plane as it was going to be cleansed and thoroughly
disinfected. We were to disrobe entirely and enter into their body
cleansing room. We had no alternative but to follow the voice's
instructions. We put our clothes into what seemed to be disinfecting
closets, and went into a steam room where we were sprayed with a
disinfecting shower. After a thorough bath and cleansing each one of
us was given by an attendant a full set of under- and over-garments
of styles comparable to the ancient Roman or Greek; two pieces of
underwear, a soft silky, loose fitting sleeveless undershirt, and
above knee length drawers; clinging socks of the same material up to
the middle of calf; shoes, leather laced Roman style up to middle of
calf. One loose over-garment, similar to a very soft linen material,
like a Roman tunica, open at the neck, girded at the waist, reaching to
the knees, with above elbow sleeves. Another over-garment was similar
to the Roman dalmatica; it was a soft rayon fabric, open at the neck,
reaching to just below the knees, with wide elbow sleeves; ornamented
with one inch purple or lavender bands around its neck, sleeves and
bottom edges; with a belt at the waist.</p>

<p>All garments and shoes were fastened with detachable buttons. The
attendant told us they were heat and fresh air dispenser atomic
batteries. They supplied the exact required degree of necessary body
air conditioning in all kinds of weather. The fibrous materials of
these garments were not only fresh air and heat radiation conductors,
but were also fire-proof.</p>

<p>Our attendant also gave us a one inch lavender ribbon for our heads.
He showed us how to wear it, as he did, tied with a small knot at the
back. Some of the boys were smiling a little; I think the attendant
sensed their amusement. "You look quite handsome now," he joked.</p>

<p>He told us all clothing was worn only once. The same applied to
household linens. Clothing and linens were worn, then sent back to the
factory to be crushed into pulp and made over again. "We don't consider
laundries sanitary," he said.</p>

<p>Over-garments like the stolla, tunica and the dalmatica were worn for
one week, or less; when soiled, they were also fabricated over again.
But all garments, new or worn, were sun rayed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span> disinfected every
day before being worn. Our own clothes, which by this time were also
disinfected and sun-ray sterilized, were stored away, excepting my log
book papers, diary books and shorthand notebooks. Our clothes were to
be given to us when we returned to earth. We were relieved at the time
to learn our stay was to be only temporary.</p>

<p>After dressing, he again assured us that our captors were friendly and
that we must not be afraid; they had a motive for their actions which
they would fully explain to our satisfaction. Later we consulted among
ourselves and decided that since we were entirely at the mercy of these
strange men, we had no choice but to obey.</p>

<p>He then guided us into an antechamber where he told us to leave our
firearms, parachutes, breathing suits, and other accoutrements. Then
mentioned us to follow him. He assured us our property would be held
safely and returned to us. The attendant puzzled me by anticipating
my wish in suggesting that I take out my pencil and notebook from the
disinfector and take them along so that I could take down notes on what
took place. Then, with great ceremony, he ushered us into a large,
high ceilinged, beautifully decorated sunlit room, where about fifty
men were seated, all dressed in Roman style. They wore their hair cut
short, with a mass of short, wavy curls around the ears, bound around
with a one inch lavender ribbon. They were all clean shaven, with hair
parted on the right or left side. Facing us at the far end of the room,
standing near a large desk, was their leader, who wore a distinctive
over-garment called the toga; a loose, long, sleeveless wrapper,
gracefully thrown over the left shoulder and arm, girdled around the
waist, decorated at the edges with a filet of gold. He also wore a one
inch wide gold filet ribbon around his head. With great courtesy he
bowed low to us and greeted each of us by our full name.</p>

<p>"We welcome you to our ship," he began, "even though you may be
unwilling guests at this moment. But after you have heard our reasons
for capturing you, and see what we want to show you, you will only be
too glad that we took these means to get you here.</p>

<p>"We are Martians from the planet Mars, which is today about fifty-eight
million miles away from your earth. Since this is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span> day of the year
when our two worlds are the closest together, we planned to use it in
some way to contact you. We wanted to land on your globe and deliver
our message, but its invincible gravitational attraction is so powerful
that once we landed, we could not, under any circumstances, overcome
and detach ourselves from it. Therefore, we have brought you into our
orbit, and we shall now explain our reasons.</p>

<p>"On Mars we received all your radio waves. We heard all the languages
used on your earth. But try as we would, we were not able to send our
radio waves to your earth. There is a strange, strong interference.
Your earth has a protective shell of electrically charged gases, some
sixty miles thick, clinging to it. This shell seriously disturbs the
travels of our radio waves in your atmosphere. It prevented us from
making communications. That is one of the reasons we captured your
plane; we wished to analyze your radio transmitter and find the metal
or element which would help us pierce through.</p>

<p>"We knew about your orders to destroy your secret mechanisms and
transmitter; we would have deterred you, but you were too quick for us.
Even this action does not discourage us. We shall capture another plane
in the same way we have captured yours—or perhaps you will help us to
obtain a transmitter, after you understand our purpose. We aim to send
radio messages to your Earth people. After you gentlemen have seen the
way we live, you may help us by becoming friendly ambassadors to your
own people.</p>

<p>"We are now taking you to our planet to show you our way of life.
You may stay with us as long as you like—see everything, learn
everything." Then the speaker turned to me with a smile, "You were
perplexed when our attendant told you to take along your pencil and
notebook; he read your thoughts and anticipated your wish.</p>

<p>"I want to warn you, that we have a sixth sense, the faculty of
reading, receiving, and transmitting thought waves, even over long
distances. This faculty is very highly developed in us. You people of
the Earth also possess it, but in a limited subconscious and dormant
state; you may develop it in the future. We can read your thoughts,
and we ask that you please try your best to control<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span> them so as not to
offend us. We have long ago, through training, learned to control our
thoughts and minds, the guiding spirits of our actions.</p>

<p>"You will be surprised to learn how great our knowledge is of Earth
people. Each language is clear to us, because we read the thoughts
of your inhabitants. Our television cabinets are so perfect that we
can see everywhere on earth. We clearly hear all that is being said.
Through constant evolution, we have developed in ourselves an acute
mental receptive faculty of hypermnesis, extraordinary power of quick
mental absorption, and a sharp lasting memory. It is very easy for us
to learn any of your languages.</p>

<p>"We would certainly like to send you television pictures showing how we
live, but television receives the same interference as our radio waves.
You are surprised at the natural forces we command, no doubt. We'll try
to explain. As a pilot you have studied astronomy. You know that our
planet—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Mars is the most interesting object in the heavens for your
scientists, because it is the one and only world where they appear to
have found direct evidence of life and because some astronomers have
held the opinion that it provides evidence for the existence on it of
intelligent beings.'<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>'Our planet revolves in an orbit, that is outside the orbit of the
earth, its mean distance from the sun being a little more than one and
one-half times that of the earth.'<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>'The distance of Mars from the sun varies by more than twenty-six
million miles. It requires a period of a little short of two years for
Mars to complete one revolution in its orbit.'<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>'The diameter of Mars is about 4,215 miles, only a little more than
half that of the earth. Its weight is rather more than one-tenth of
the weight of the earth.'<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>'The rotation period is about twenty-four hours, thirty-seven and
one-half minutes.'<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>'Length of the Martian year is 687 days.'<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>'Our seasons are nearly twice as long as yours.'</p>

<p>'They found that the vast extent of our continent was furrowed upon
every side by a network of numerous lines or fine stripes.'<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>'That traversed the planet for long distances in regular lines and
extended for thousands of miles; the breadth of some may be as great
as one or two hundred miles; of others, not more than twenty miles.'<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>'The channels intersected one another at all possible angles:<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>

and these channels were truly great furrows or depressions in the
surface of the Planet, destined for the passage of water.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Some
of these channels run straight and double paralleling others with
absolute geometrical precision, as if they were the work of rule or
compass.'<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>'They found that many of the canals converged to dusky patches at their
junctions, the so-called oasis, and passed from one oasis to another
in an absolutely unswerving direction,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> proving that they have
pumping systems, on a scale far surpassing any of the works of man,
and this in itself, presupposes an advanced type of intelligence.'<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>
</div>

<p>"This is a description of our planet; you will see for yourselves that
your astronomers were right in their surmise.</p>

<p>"Since you Earth people discovered radio, we receive your world space
echo waves within three minutes. Our thought reading and our remote
reading faculty control and our television are so powerful that we
can see and read from here, your books,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span> newspapers and periodicals.
We know what is in your concrete and steel safes. We pierce through
your earth's surface within your deepest caves and mines. To our
consternation we see a terrible picture of Earth man's treatment of his
fellow human beings. Frequently his selfishness and ruthless brutality
lead to pestilence, famine and destruction. He seems to be heading
toward the extinction of the little civilization he has gained.</p>

<p>"Our women and children are not allowed to see some of your horrible
scenes. We are certainly very happy on our planet Mars; we are grateful
we do not have to struggle through the ordeals of the men on earth. We
feel it is not necessary for you to continue so.</p>

<p>"Since what is happening on your earth has become intolerable to us, we
have decided on action. We see only total annihilation for your good
people if the others are allowed to continue in their present behavior
patterns. You now are able to understand our objectives are not
aggressive but humanitarian. We would like to act as advisors to those
people of earth who are capable of change, feel the need of change but
are at a loss where to start.</p>

<p>"But, you must be hungry. We have an insulated room, adjoining this
one. Here no one can read your thoughts or hear your conversation. That
is where we hold our own secret conferences, there you may adjourn for
an hour for food, refreshment, and consultation among yourselves. When
you have finished, I will be waiting for you."</p>

<p>I had been taking down his comments. I knew then I was entering into a
new world.</p>

<p>We were led into an adjoining room of about 30′ by 60′, where a table
was placed and set for us. In front of each of our eleven chairs was
a place card with the name of each of us. An attendant served us all
kinds of tasty foods from heavy, solid gold and silver tureens and
platters. Food and service were of the best. When we had finished our
excellent meal, the attendant told us that he was leaving, and that we
could shut the door and safely converse among ourselves.</p>

<p>You can imagine our feelings. Our senses were overcome. It was
unbelievable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>Our conference was brief. Confident that for the time being we were the
friendly guest-prisoners of these strange people of another planet,
we decided to conduct ourselves as correctly as possible and to gain
information which might benefit our own people.</p>

<p>When we opened the door, the attendant, who was waiting for us, led us
back to the assembly room. All the men present rose from their chairs
and greeted us as we passed, with deep bows. We again stood in front
of their leader. He also bowed, and begged us to sit down, and said,
"I hope you gentlemen have confidence in us now, and believe in our
sincerity, and fully understand the purpose of our action."</p>

<p>Addressing himself to me, he continued, "I am aware that you wish to
ask me many questions. I know them as I read your thoughts; I shall
endeavor to anticipate a few of them.</p>

<p>"You are surprised that our airship which is traveling so fast, or
rather I should say falling or being attracted towards our planet Mars,
is going so smoothly that it seems as if we were motionless. As a
matter of fact, we are traveling at the rate of 20,000 miles per minute
in the ether of vacuum of space where all atmosphere is totally absent.
We are in a void without air pressure or friction. Our speed has no
effect on our motion nor does it cause damage to our ship. Flying time
from your atmosphere to ours is nearly forty-eight hours. We expect to
land on Mars tomorrow night.</p>

<p>"You are also wondering at our appearance. Because we have the
reputation among you of being warlike, you Earth people were led to
think that we were of abnormal physical size. You are surprised to find
us not very much unlike yourselves in looks and stature. What is your
opinion of our appearance?"</p>

<p>After carefully looking the men over and contrasting them with
ourselves, who were considered on Earth as good athletic and handsome
fellows, I answered him. "Frankly," I said, "Your men are as like us
as our high bred champion race horses in their prime are like the nags
that pull our junk wagons. The other difference between us seems to
be, the extramuscular development of your shoulders and arms plus an
apparently longer arm reach than we have."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>I had to give them credit for their white clear skin, their regular
features, their vigor, and their erect posture. Their proud, but frank
and gentle appearance exuded powerful heavenly personality. There were
among them many men with deep sky-blue and grass-green skin, colored
men, who also were the same fine specimens of manhood.</p>

<p>Then their leader answered, "There is nothing superhuman or
supernatural about us. We as yet have not reached perfection. From what
we have observed of Earth men, I would say we are more healthy, virile,
better developed physically, also mentally. I mean no offense, our
intellectual force is much more advanced than Earth men. But you still
have a chance eventually to reach our development, if you will only
seize the opportunity."</p>

<p>"You will notice among us Martians something else which will surprise
you. Look us over. How old do you think he is?" the leader asked,
pointing to their youngest, an erect young man.</p>

<p>"Why," I replied, "I should say about 25 years old."</p>

<p>They all laughed.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "This one, who is our youngest, is now 100 Earth years
old. You will notice that none of us have any gray hair, wrinkles,
or false teeth; those few of us with false teeth acquired them by
accidentally breaking their own. None of us use eye glasses or hearing
aids. There are no bald-headed men on Mars. Our old people reach the
age of 150 Martian years or 300 Earth years.</p>

<p>"Our women, even those past middle age, retain their natural color
texture, youthful figures, velvety skin and texture of their soft,
youthful hair.</p>

<p>"Due to our planet's distance from the sun, our seasons and years are
double yours. Our minimum life span, according to natural phenomenon
is 200 Earth years. Because of our careful way of life, we have
extended it to 300 years. Since Earth is so near to the sun, your year
and seasons are half the length of ours; the hypothesis is that your
minimum life span should be at least 100 to 150 Earth years, providing
you lead a natural life, similar to ours.</p>

<p>"Your perverted actions and corrupt standards of living diminished
your life span to nearly half of what it should be. Your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span> habits have
made your bodies fertile ground for diseases which deprive you of
vitality, consume your life, and, by transmission, attack your progeny.
Thus large numbers of you are destroyed within half, or less, of your
allotted period of life.</p>

<p>"Our long life has evolved from thousands of years of constant
improvement in our way of living. Some of the causes for our prolonged
youth and vigor are freedom from fear, no worry and no misery. Our
entire life is based on the principles of love, peace, and common
brotherhood. By periodic physical and dental examinations of everyone
and proper treatment afterwards, we are constantly preventing as well
as curing injuries and diseases. These examinations and treatments are
compulsory and take place weekly or more often, as the cases demand.
We are also encouraged to participate in healthy exercise daily.
Since we understand its importance, we have real enjoyment of our own
participating in games and other forms of exercise.</p>

<p>"Hundreds of thousands of years ago, before the invention of flying
machines, our ancestors felt that they should be able to train
themselves to fly like birds. They started intensive arm and shoulder
exercise to develop a very swift whole arm movement, similar to that of
birds. Since water swimming could easily be learned by special arm and
leg movements, there was no reason why they couldn't adapt themselves
to fly in the air with arm-attached wings. It took many generations of
training muscle and bone before they could overcome the disadvantage
of weight and lack of bird body buoyancy; however, they succeeded in
mastering flying. That is why we have longer arms and more muscular and
bone development of our shoulders and arms than you Earth men.</p>

<p>"Health exercises, health rays, diets, and body massages, have kept us
young looking, healthy, and vigorous and have kept our body weight very
near to normal even in the aged. We prohibit the use of habit-forming
foods, tobacco, drugs, and beverages other than low alcoholic beers and
wines in limited quantities. Too many of you on Earth carry to extremes
a commonplace habit, until it becomes a menace to your health."</p>

<p>I was disappointed at the ban on smoking because we had plenty of
cigarettes and were craving a smoke. He immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span> understood and
said, "We will put no restrictions upon your desire to smoke as long
as your cigarettes last. We do not smoke because we do not allow
contamination of our fresh air with smoke, no matter how harmless.
Self-control is a nerve and emotion tonic and exercise; smoking is a
nerve stimulator and pacifier, and dulling them. In time a craving for
the stimulant is created, contributing gradually to their weakening.
It is a strong habit-forming pastime. We do not need it as we have no
nerve tension.</p>

<p>"We lead a well regulated life. Our bodies and nerves get the full
rest they require nightly. All our activities cease at 9:00 p.m. and
everyone must be in bed by 11:00 p.m. week days. Naturally, exceptions
are made for doctors, hospital personnel and workers in necessary
utilities."</p>

<p>It was getting late; the meeting broke up. All the Martians present
began mingling among us, trying to put us at our ease. After we had
been served with refreshments, they began to leave. We were left
nearly alone with their leader. He said kindly, "You gentlemen must be
tired. Our attendant will lead you to your sleeping quarters." Then
he bowed to me and said, "Good night." When I offered to shake hands,
he politely refused, remarking, "We do not shake hands; it is not
customary with us nor is it sanitary. Hand holding and fondling is done
only within our intimate family circle. I am glad to know that Earth
people are gradually adopting a practice which is old among us and
universal—that of using the self-opening door, thereby doing away with
unsanitary door handles."</p>

<p>We went outside and up a stairway to our sleeping quarters. Our
attendant assured us that the beds and bedding were sun health rayed
and sterilized, a daily precaution practiced everywhere. New night
garments, as well as underclothing for our next day's use were laid
out for us on chairs. The bed linens and night garments were as white
as ours, but softer, and they felt like pure silk. The attendant
then pulled out metal beds and springs with mattresses, pillows, and
blankets from a wall closet. The mattresses and pillows were of a
spongy rubber substance, and felt soft and comfortable.</p>

<p>After making our beds and placing pitchers of water for us on a small
table, the attendant wished us a good night's sleep. Before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span> retiring I
wrote in my diary, in detail about what happened to us that day.</p>

<p>After a good night's sleep, we awoke, eager to see what the new day
would bring. The attendant brought in the clothes allotted to us,
pressed and ready for wear. A hot and cold, scented, sterilized water
shower gave us an exhilarating body cleansing. We dressed and were
led into a breakfast room, where it was ready for us. Afterward, we
were taken on a tour of their ship. Some of us took the opportunity of
looking out through space, admiring the grand sights of the universe
and pointing out many known stars, even a tiny one far away, our own
former home, the Earth.</p>

<p>I went, notebook in hand, with their leader, to look over the intricate
instruments and machinery, and the general construction of their
immense airship. The ship was now falling fast, attracted by the
gravitational pull of the planet Mars. It seemed to me motionless. Her
pilot told me that when we were about a million miles away from Mars,
he would put a brake on her speed and come to a dead stop before he
slowly entered her stratosphere. "Then I will put our motors to work
when we travel in our atmosphere, you will feel nearly the same motion
that you do in your own planes."</p>

<p>When I asked him what kind of gas he used, he answered, "We use atomic
energy; some machines and motors use ocean-wave electric energy, others
use concentrated sun-ray energy. We use no gas, oil, or coal, even
though we have them in great abundance. Their fumes, gases, and smoke
would pollute our fresh air. Furthermore, coal mining is hazardous and
we do not want to endanger the lives of our potential miners."</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>This is only the beginning, the first chapter of my strange story which
I wrote on my return. There are a great many details I would like to
give you; but since I want to finish as quickly as possible, I am
omitting description and details of minor matters. Tomorrow I will give
you my second chapter, a bird's-eye view of a city on Mars.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p class="center" ><i>The Landing</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The next day</span>, at the same hour, I found the Lieutenant sitting in the
hot sun on the same bench. I asked him if he would like to walk a
couple of blocks further, where it was not so sunny.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "this spot reminds me of a certain parkway in Amboria,
a city on Mars, where I used to sit with the most beautiful girl in
the Universe. Of course, this place can hardly compare in natural
beauty with the one there." Then he stopped talking, and by his rapt
expression I judged he was recalling pleasant memories.</p>

<p>My presence had no effect on his concentration; he was, for the
time being, in another world. After about fifteen minutes he became
conscious of his environment. Opening and rubbing his eyes, he said,</p>

<p>"I am very sorry I stopped talking so abruptly. I suddenly felt as
though I were in Amboria again, and Xora was encouraging me to have
patience, and not to despair, because she loved me. The realization
that I am doomed to remain here on this Earth is bitter; however, I
still have hope that Xora and her grandfather will someday rescue me.</p>

<p>"That hope keeps me eternally watching the skies. With their power of
thought reading, I am sure that they can locate me here; otherwise I
would become insane." Taking a picture from his pocket of a beautiful
young girl, with the inscription on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span> bottom "To Fred from your
Xora," he handed it to me. Her beauty was angelic.</p>

<p>The picture was an odd disc of some strange metal or composition, about
six inches in diameter and a quarter inch thick. One face of it showed
a moving picture of our lieutenant reclining under a tree with her, or
promenading, the other side showed the loving facial expressions of the
beautiful girl.</p>

<p>By pressing the center spot of the disc, I heard her melodious voice
giving him loving messages of encouragement and hope. It was a
concentrated record. And took a long time to play it. Fred seemed to be
in a state of deep enchantment.</p>

<p>He said, "This picture reminds me constantly that what has happened to
me was no dream.</p>

<p>"I am sure I can go back to Amboria, if I can get possession of a
plane; but I am known at all airfields, and no one would lend me a
plane, or even let me be a passenger. I can't buy one, as my money is
tied up. I don't know what to do. I know how to communicate with the
Martians by radio, but I would rather wait until I am able to complete
all arrangements. They cannot talk to me until I get within reach of
their radio waves by airplane."</p>

<p>To solve this problem, I suggested the following:</p>

<p>"If you will give me the complete story of your experiences and grant
me permission to publish it, I will lend you enough money to purchase
an airplane and transmitter. There is just one condition; the story be
worthwhile enough to interest a publisher; the royalties then may cover
the loan."</p>

<p>My offer gave him new hope. His face brightened. With youthful
enthusiasm he grasped my hand, exclaiming, "Then you do believe that my
story is true and that I am sane!" I answered, "Of course I do." This
inspired him with greater confidence, and he said, "Now to continue my
story." Then he handed me another typewritten chapter.</p>

<p>That evening, I continued to read his adventures. I was no longer
skeptical.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Martian airship was fast nearing its destination. In the late<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
afternoon when we reached their stratosphere, I began to feel the
delicate motion of the ship and the vibration of its motors. Her fast
and silent driving power got her into their atmosphere, as their pilot
told me it would, without any shock or collision. The large size of the
ship helped her to ride out the air pockets more easily and smoothly
than our planes. My friends and I did not suffer so much from air
sickness, as we used to on our own ships on Earth.</p>

<p>Alongside, above, and below us there was a heavy traffic of planes
of all sizes, shapes, and strange designs, flying safely in the air
space, criss-crossing each other with the utmost freedom, at different
altitudes, and in different directions. We were signaled by uniformed,
specially designed planes. These planes, the pilot explained, were
directors of air traffic, like our street traffic policemen.</p>

<p>Another thing attracted my attention. All their planes and air ships,
both large and small, had a mast jutting from the nose, giving them a
resemblance to swordfish. I asked the pilot the purpose of the masts.
"They are fog-dispelling masts," he answered. "They shoot out long
waves which dispel fogs, and also purify the atmosphere by killing
bacteria within their reach. We have them everywhere on Mars. We
exterminate all bacteria before they cause diseases in human beings,
domestic animals, and in necessary vegetation."</p>

<p>Their leader now came along and told me that they expected to land that
evening. "Just as soon as we get beneath the clouds, we shall be above
a great water, and you will see one of our oceans."</p>

<p>We were now over the ocean, a large body of dark-blue, turbulent
water with many freight ships, going in all directions. They had no
smoke-stacks but freight center masts, with one of them sticking out
from the bows. I asked the leader about them. He explained, "There are
no smoke-stacks, for, as you have already learned, we do not use oil,
coal, or gas; that front mast has the same function as the mast on the
airship, to dispel fog and kill bacteria. These ships are used for
heavy freight transportation between continents. They are thoroughly
seaworthy and unsinkable.</p>

<p>"Since the population of our planet is much greater than yours,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span> our
production must be greater. Each of our continents has different
climate, soil, and natural resources; each produces different
necessities. We try to intensify such production at its source in
order to produce in equal amount for the consumption of all of us.
Nature often does not help us to produce the full quota of our
requirements; we then store surpluses in times of plenty to provide for
times of scarcity. We equally ration among our races our products and
manufactures.</p>

<p>"There is little waste or spoilage in harvesting and distribution, and
very little handling. At harvest time or during emergency industrial
shortages of help, we call for volunteers. Even our highest Sun-Rank
members volunteer. We invariably get more help than we need.</p>

<p>"We manufacture articles at the source of their raw materials, thus
saving labor, transportation, distribution and time."</p>

<p>Pointing to what seemed a small island in the middle of the ocean, he
said, "This spot is one of our anchored, ocean way stations which we
have every thousand square miles, on all our seas. They are used for
supply bases, way stations for planes and ships' repair shops, traveler
stop-offs, fish canning and storage, and submarine bases. No, not as
you are thinking—battleships; our subs are very large peace freight
ships.</p>

<p>"The waters as well as the floors of our seas are very fertile and
have, along with fish and shell foods, an inexhaustible supply of
all kinds of cereals, vegetables, fruits, plus sea forest; there are
also minerals and valuable chemicals for industrial and medical uses
and for fertilizing purposes. Our submarines, besides being used for
transporting these natural elements of the deep, are also used as
dredges, planters, cultivators, harvesters, and sawing mills on the
floors of three-quarters of our seas and oceans, where pressure is not
so strong. Our sea fruits, vegetables, and cereals which we harvest are
not only very tasty, but nutritious; the woods we obtain from the trees
are some of our best: hard, pliable and resilient. The waters protect
them from fires. No doubt your seas also have an abundant supply of all
these."</p>

<p>Far away on the horizon we could see a long shore line, with large
buildings at equal distances from each other. "These buildings, which
you see," the leader pointed out, "are big dams. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span> are on all
our shores, spaced at one hundred mile intervals, and are about ten
times larger than your biggest dam. They are built to withstand the
constant battering of the most powerful waves. Natural wave forces also
create our electric light power and energy. Large filters, distilling,
sterilizing, and refining plants extract from the sea water salt and
other ingredients for our use, the water is then fresh and palatable
for our consumption. This water is stored in immense reservoirs and
pumped into our homes and to our hot water plants. The hot water and
steam in turn are pumped wherever needed. We also use for power, heat,
and other purposes powerful volcanic steam from wells drilled deep
into the crust of our planet. We don't have to entirely depend on
precipitation for our fresh water supply, like you Earth people do,
during your frequent drought periods, which create famines for your
inhabitants, and the destruction of your vegetations. Neither do we
have to create cloud rains, as we have more than enough water for all
our necessities. We even have secondary large fresh water reservoirs
in our former deserts which have become productive. Our powerful pumps
and our permanent automatic systems of cold water sprinklers and hot
water and air pipes keep all our croplands, orchards, and in fact all
our cultivations fully supplied, and thermostatically heat protected
against frosts, snow storms, and freeze-ups.</p>

<p>"The waters of all our fresh water lakes, large and small rivers, and
springs are carefully guarded against pollution. They are always fit,
and safe for human consumption. We also have many dams on our rivers.
We use the abundant forces of nature at our command, of more than is
sufficient for our needs, even if Mars' population were doubled.</p>

<p>"Mother Nature is very generous in her abundant and unlimited gifts.
We have harnessed only a few of them. Every day we discover new and
better elements. From time to time our mode of life improves through
their adaptation and reconstruction. Thus we are kept busy creating new
occupations and abandoning some of the old and useless ones."</p>

<p>We were speedily nearing land. They flew low, circling around to
give us a bird's-eye view of a great stretch of suburban and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span> city
habitations, I would say ten times larger than New York City and its
surroundings.</p>

<p>It was a vast area of both natural and artificial gardens landscaped
between two wide crystal-clear water rivers, where a large number of
ships of all sizes were sailing. This land between the rivers was
divided into equal sections within which were square, circular, and
other kinds of geometrically shaped courts enclosed with beautiful
buildings of diversified types. Some were similar to our Gothic,
French, and Italian renaissance; others similar to our Spanish patios
and magnificent oriental constructions but including their own
predominating gorgeous designs and architectures. All these were fitted
into a design most pleasing to the eye. Strange and beautiful, not like
the monotony of our architecture with its few variations.</p>

<p>To my pleasant surprise, I saw no sewer polluted, and unsanitary
river waters, no mobile traffic, no autos, busses, trolleys, or other
moving vehicles. I saw no signs, electric posts, parking meters, water
hydrants, telephone wiring, wash lines or vent pipes. There was a total
absence of unsightly billboards which clutter up our highways and
boulevards.</p>

<p>The air space above roofs was devoid of all obstructions, with the
exception of the colored and very visible radio and fog-dispelling,
air-purifying, and bacteria-killing masts, which I readily recognized.
It was becoming dark as we were nearing our landing. I could see a
great number of small luminous bodies, traveling above the surface in
different directions, which looked like and reminded me of fireflies. I
found out afterwards they were Martians, flying like birds, with large
wing attachments on their arms, and red lights on their heads.</p>

<p>We were now approaching one of their large airports outside the city,
across one of their rivers, where we were ordered to land and to wheel
the ship into a very large building. Nobody was there to meet us
because all of us including the Martians, were under strict quarantine.</p>

<p>We again had to undergo the cleansing and disinfecting, but this time
more intensified. Their health inspectors and medical specialists began
to take all kinds of careful tests to be sure we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span> did not bring in any
diseases or that we did not carry any dangerous microbes. We remained
here for three days.</p>

<p>On the last day, after again being thoroughly examined, we were given
a clean bill of health. Our airship leader, who, I was told, was a
first-degree Sun-Rank member, an important dignitary, and who, I could
see, was given honorable recognition and homage by everyone, appointed
himself my host. He said the rest of our boys were also being taken as
guests by other fellow Martian travelers.</p>

<p>Again cautioning every one of us to try his utmost to control his
thoughts, he led me to his private plane. We left the airport for his
home. He gave me a parachute and fastened on his arms a pair of folded
large snow shoes.</p>

<p>"These are flying wings," he said. "I am putting them on in case of
accident. Before we reach my home I want to tell you something that may
please you. The medical reports about you and your friends are very
satisfactory. After a few months with us, if you follow our health
habits, we expect you to become just as healthy and vigorous as any one
of our young Martians. But you will never acquire our sixth sense of
thought reading and transmission, or our bird-flying motions. But by
following our way of living, your life span will be extended far beyond
Earth standards, even if it does not reach our span of 300 years.</p>

<p>"Our head examiner said it was safe for us to take you to our homes.
If you men desire, you may remain indefinitely among us, and look for
wives among our girls. You all are able to rear families of healthy
Martians. But after consulting with members of our council, they said
that if you decided to remain on Mars, you would first have to deserve
and earn the Martian citizenship. They decided if you will help me
in my plans for your Earth people you will be elected to honorable
citizenship of Mars.</p>

<p>"We are, as you notice, flying very slowly. My home is in the suburbs
of the city, near by, about 500 miles distant. My wife and my
fourth-generation granddaughter, together with other members of our
household are waiting to receive you. I am sure they will find you
a welcome guest. I also wish to tell you that we have learned your
English language. Every one will be able to converse freely with you.
You will feel quite at home. It would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span> be wise if you men learned our
Martian language so that you could mingle with other Martians."</p>

<p>While we were flying, I was constantly looking above and below us at
the innumerable, beautiful airships of all kinds, designs, and sizes
flying in all directions.</p>

<p>Glancing below I was astounded to see a garden of Eden with angel
figures winging their way over an oasis of blended color. While he had
been talking, my companion was preparing to land on his own landing
platform. Attendants were on hand to assist us from the plane. A woman
of dignity and beauty and a charming young girl were awaiting our
arrival. They seemed from another world. No marks of care and anxiety
on their faces. They looked to me like the angels I remembered from
childhood on Christmas cards. They were dressed in flowing Roman
stolas, that appeared to be of very fine linen, falling to their feet,
fastened at the shoulders and upper arms by ornamented atomic battery
buttons. They wore beautiful bracelets on their arms. Their stolas,
girdled at the waist, were semi-décolleté reflecting their healthy,
white skin. Two ribbons running over the shoulders crossed themselves
in front and back to reach the girdle belt. On the sides under the
arms, the gowns were ornamented and fell in a cascade effect into
folds, open from the knees down and trailing on the ground at the back.</p>

<p>Their hair was dressed with wavy small curls in front from ear to ear.
In the back it fell in beautiful waves.</p>

<p>The older woman wore an inch wide gold fillet band encircling her head.</p>

<p>They welcomed us in a most friendly manner. Introducing his wife to me
as Lady Sylvia Banard and the young lady as Miss Xora Savona, he took
hold of his wife's arm, indicating that I do the same with Miss Savona.
We followed them into their sumptuous dining room for dinner.</p>

<p>The conversation centered on his adventure to Earth and back again,
while all the members of the party kept watching me. I especially
noticed the friendly, slightly curious side glances of Xora. Evidently
these girls on Mars had some of the nice traits of our girls. At least
they were feminine enough to be curious. I had difficulty keeping my
mind on the conversation but I remembered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span> my manners and tried to join
in. After dinner we went into their library, and I remained until I was
left alone with Sun-Rank Banard.</p>

<p>One thought was in my mind, which he knew, but he let me question
him. "May I ask an important, but perhaps a personal question without
offending?"</p>

<p>"I know your question. There is no offense. Ask it."</p>

<p>"You told me that Miss Xora Savona is your grandchild of the fourth
generation, so I presume you are over one hundred Earth years old.
You and Lady Banard and other Martians of your age look so youthful
that, no doubt, you are still virile. How do you people control the
overpopulation of Mars?"</p>

<p>He answered, "We limit, and control our birth rate, preventing its
overpopulation. Our method of control is very simple. Whereas in many
parts of your Earth, with all your preventives, aborti-facients,
and your criminal dangerous abortion operations, your population is
increasing to a dangerous point of saturation, creating scarcity,
undernourishment, famine, and starvation. Chaos will soon overtake you,
unless you control these over-birth rates. By our process we control
not only the number of coming children, but their sex as well. We can
maintain an even balance in sex and also prevent the unfortunates who
are not fit to have children from having them. Even with our large
population, our planet is as yet hardly half populated. If it were
fully populated, our production of all necessities of life would still
be more than ample for our needs. In one year, we can produce enough
for three years. We always have a generous surplus of everything,
because our storage facilities are perfect, and we have no waste.</p>

<p>"We protect our lands against dust storms and other causes of erosion.
We do not allow their abandonment; we do not allow any waste. All
our soils are constantly analyzed and suitably fertilized to prevent
a lack of necessary elements. This treatment results in plants of
above-average food value, and of a balanced mineral nutrition, a
combination promoting good health.</p>

<p>"The drying up of marshlands and other wastelands plus the perfect
irrigation of our deserts has helped us considerably to increase our
production, and to almost exterminate pestilent insects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>"Lands not in active production are forested or put to rich grazing
use. Our permanent large pumping, drenching, and sprinkling system,
with our large sprinkler planes, are used to irrigate our deserts, and
other lands suffering from drought and rain scarcity. It is also used
in putting out forest fires started either by sun rays or combustion.</p>

<p>"We draw the waters from our great number of immense reserve storage
reservoirs, which are directly diverted to them from the run-offs of
heavy river water flows. Saving us from overflowing rivers, flood
control, levee construction, inundation damage, and disasters, at the
same time increasing generating power of our dams. We have an efficient
drainage system for our tropical crops in rain-soaked lands, excess
waters of which also flow into these reservoirs. Sun rays are available
to treat our vegetation, when necessary.</p>

<p>"We limit and regulate agricultural production all over Mars. We have
always an overabundance, because we have also completely reclaimed,
irrigated, and fertilized our arid areas, distant from our surface
water and reservoir supply, by mapping and using their underground
water resources; we have converted them into rich productive farm
lands. We have also mastered our jungle lands and made them all very
productive.</p>

<p>"You are reluctant to ask me a few more questions you feel I may be
sensitive about answering. You are puzzled about a fourth generation.
Since our generation is thirty Earth years, I would have to be about
150 years old to have a fourth generation grandchild. I am now 175
years old, and Xora is now twenty-six Earth years old, which makes her
my fourth generation grandchild. Xora has been appointed as your guide;
she will take you tomorrow to her home, where you will meet her family
and friends. You will be free to mingle among and closely observe us.
You will find out for yourself that we have high standards and happy
life.</p>

<p>"'Regnant populi.' The people rule, with a political regime really 'of
the people, by the people, and for the people,' through their short
term elected representatives; a truly democratic form of government,
as defined by your Webster's Dictionary, 'Democracy: Government by the
people collectively by elected representatives;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span> political, or social
equality,' united for common interests, rights and privileges, in
political, economic, and social equality. We have strong doctrines of
individual freedom, 'Lalus populi suprema est lex,' the welfare of the
people is the supreme law.</p>

<p>"Our government officials are elected for two or five years, depending
upon location and departments. They are not allowed to succeed
themselves. Dictatorship is non-existent nor would it be tolerated. We
have no ruling class. We are ruled by the people. We have no secrecy
in our government, nor in our political parties, no party cliques and
party discipline. Important decisions are voted for, or against, by all
our citizens.</p>

<p>"You are curious and want to know if all Martians live in the same
splendor and style as I do. No, they do not. We have ten grades and
ten Sun-Rank degrees. Between every grade and every degree there are
ten points to be earned. Every one of us must earn all ten points for
promotion into the next degree.</p>

<p>"Promotion into the honorable Sun-Ranks is obtained only if we have
achieved something outstanding, such as an improvement or invention,
a scientific discovery, a disease prevention and cure. These higher
advancements are voted upon and approved by our supreme house of
council, and are given to us after judgment has been passed by
impartial judges of all races from different parts of our planet.</p>

<p>"The type of living quarters of members in the Sun-Rank degrees depends
on the degree. The members not only are honored for their attainment,
but the higher ranking members are given, for their lifetime or for as
long as they desire, mansions in both summer and winter resorts. They
have large yachts and planes assigned to them and enjoy comforts and
luxuries. They all have their duties to perform during their hours of
employment. There is no ostentation in their way of life; for their
entertainment, they attend the same theatres and halls as the lowest
grade degree members. Stalls, boxes, and the best orchestra seats are
always first reserved for the aged, and the next for rank members. Some
of them prefer to occupy seats in the balcony with their lower degree
families and friends.</p>

<p>"Many of our highest rank members prefer to remain in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span> old homes
where they began as citizens. Many others go back to them if they are
still available. Rank members are not envied. Respect and desire to
emulate them spur all of us on.</p>

<p>"I have only reached my Sun-Rank first degree very recently. None of my
children have as yet reached my rank. They and their children can visit
me for a short time, but it would not be ethical for me to keep them,
nor would any of them want to remain in our home permanently.</p>

<p>"The children of our Sun-Rank members, at their maturity, revert to the
living standards of our lowest grade degree members.</p>

<p>"Now it's getting late, and no doubt you are bewildered and tired." To
an attendant, who suddenly appeared, he said, "Please lead Lieutenant
Balmore to his sleeping chamber. Good night."</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><i>Amboria the Paradise</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><i>When we met next day, he handed me his third chapter.</i></p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The next morning</span> after breakfast <i>en famille</i>, Xora led me outside
and into a hangar, where a few planes of different sizes were standing.
She went to a corner closet where there was an assortment of what I
would call large, light weight snow shoes. They had two parts, hinged
together and pliable, similar to those I saw in Sun-Rank Banard's
plane. They were covered by a thin fabric with clasps on one surface
and were of different colors to blend with her garments. She fastened
them tightly on both her arms, and flapping them like bird wings, she
swiftly lifted herself off the ground. She flew around gracefully
showing me all kinds of tricks. When she came down, Xora told me that
it was too bad I did not know how to bird-fly, but that we could take
her small tandem.</p>

<p>She picked up a few small contraptions which I helped her carry
outside. The piece I carried seemed to be a double seat of a swing with
attachable back and legs and with metal ropes. I thought she was going
to hang it somewhere and do some swinging; but no, she next hooked
on two flat oval pieces like oars or wings. She also screwed onto it
tightly a small propeller smokeless jet engine. When the legs were
lowered, it became a double bench seat. She sat down on one end and
asked me to sit down beside her, carefully fastening her wings on her
arms. When she gave me a bundle to strap on (she afterwards told me
it was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span> parachute), I obeyed, puzzled. She covered our knees with a
blanket and touched a button near the engine. To my great astonishment,
we both were lifted slowly off the ground.</p>

<p>Laughing at my surprise, she explained, "This is my old portable tandem
plane. It can travel 500 miles an hour. I can control its speed, and
bring it to a dead stop on any surface. It's driven by perpetual atomic
energy. First, we'll go sight-seeing above the city, and then we'll
land on the roof of my home in the city. I want you to meet my parents
and my sister and brother."</p>

<p>As I sat beside her, the pleasant scent of her hair, the nearness
and warmth of her body, and the occasional light touch of her hands
thrilled me so much that I almost lost control of myself. I told myself
I was acting like a school boy, instead of a grown man. By the faint
color in her cheeks she showed she was aware of my predicament. "You
are so lovely," I said, "that all these other marvels seem secondary.
How do you expect me to concentrate on them? By the way, isn't there a
Martian boy who will be jealous of the time you are spending with me?"</p>

<p>She hesitated a minute before she answered. "Not seriously," she
finally said. "Of course I have friends, but as yet I haven't made any
decision."</p>

<p>My heart gave an extra thump. Then there was hope for me. I asked her
if she wanted to marry a man of high rank or of low rank. She answered,
"Nowadays very few young men reach the rank degrees, but many of my
friends are hoping to marry such. But I first want one whom I love. He
must be noble, lovable, intelligent, ambitious and capable of achieving
honor by an outstanding action of which I may be proud."</p>

<p>Our talk and thoughts had so confused Xora that she was forgetting
to apply her flying rules. We were dodging and barely escaping
collisions with planes which seemed suddenly to be cluttering the sky.
A small plane came alongside us. The occupant was in uniform, which I
recognized as an air policeman's. Recognizing Xora, he cautioned her
and indicated that she was out of her flying altitude. She immediately
followed the instructions he gave. After he had left, she told me he
was a schoolmate of hers and was now serving his first year in the
general army of service, of which all policemen were members.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>"He certainly went against the rules by not giving me a summons. I
suppose he was being considerate of you as an Earth visitor to Mars."</p>

<p>During this time, I had been almost unaware of the city below. Xora now
called my attention to the view. She said the city had been constructed
five years before. It looked more like a large park than a city. There
were no streets, but wide park lanes, criss-crossing each other. There
was a large round lake in the center, surrounded by beautiful buildings.</p>

<p>Carefully kept lawns, gardens, and buildings covered all the surface
space. The roof tops were pleasant to see with no unsightly water
tanks, chimneys, signs, wiring, smoke, and junk. There were no
broken-down hulks of unoccupied buildings, no dirty, drab, or sooty
walls, no fire escapes. The flat or slanting roofs were all covered
with well kept verdure and flower beds.</p>

<p>There were courts of different shapes, five or six clustered together,
surrounded by green markings like a hedge, with a very visible letter
in the Martian calligraphy within a center flowerbed denoting, I
suppose, its number and location.</p>

<p>Along the rivers, busy waterways with freight ships and pleasure
yachts, were clean flat beaches. On the Amboria city side of the river,
on the edge and over part of the river on the extreme southern end,
many large buildings covered a space equivalent to about two hundred
and fifty New York city blocks. I asked Xora what these large buildings
were.</p>

<p>She answered, "They are our general stores."</p>

<p>"Why so large?" I wanted to know.</p>

<p>"They are the only stores we have for our city," she explained. "They
have the capacity to daily receive, unload, and store the contents
of one thousand large freight airplanes landing on their roofs,
two hundred fifty large freight ships, two hundred fifty freight
submarines, all sailing under and unloading inside the buildings, and
two hundred fifty long freight trains. If necessary, they can double
this capacity."</p>

<p>"You mean to say," I asked her, "that these stores not only store away,
but also distribute everything needed for every individual? Is your
city population large?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied. "I will take you through one of the buildings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span> on
the next shopping day when the people in our section are allowed to
shop. That will be Monday.</p>

<p>"The city is divided into six zones, and the inhabitants of each zone
are allowed to shop only on their appointed day. The stores are never
overcrowded."</p>

<p>"If you shop only one day a week," I interrupted, "then you must order
for the whole week in advance."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we must submit our list a week in advance."</p>

<p>"Suppose you haven't the time or you are sick?"</p>

<p>"Then, I order either by telephone or by mail from the catalogue, or I
can leave my list at our commissary department."</p>

<p>"You just told me you have only one set of stores. Then you also have
commissary departments?"</p>

<p>"Our commissary department," she said, "is only the distributing point
where we get our daily food and beverages. We don't have to shop for
them in the large, center stores."</p>

<p>We now came above a round court fringed around by private homes. Slowly
descending, we landed on the roof of one of the houses, where Xora's
family, who were expecting us, were waiting to receive us.</p>

<p>Xora introduced me to her mother, father, young sister and brother. All
welcomed me with cordiality. There is no need for me to describe them.
Nature had been kind to them.</p>

<p>As I was following them down to their living room, her father said,
"Lieutenant Balmore, you must feel strange landing so suddenly on our
planet, but we are your friends, and we will try our utmost to make you
feel at home.</p>

<p>"Of course, since everything on Mars is unfamiliar to you, you must be
anxious to see everything. Let me begin by showing you our home. It
is large enough for our family and for guests. It is fully insulated;
weather, water, fire, germ, and insect proof, outside and inside.
We use concentrated sun rays for heat and light, and atomic energy
for power and cooking. It is air conditioned. We get the desired
temperature and humidity in all seasons; the inside temperature
thermostat is set by our health officer, who does not allow too cold or
over-heated living quarters. The house is thoroughly dust proof. The
electronic dust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span> catcher and dirt remover cleans our walls, floors,
ceilings, and even our furniture, and frees the air of all foreign
articles.</p>

<p>"Each room is fully exposed at different times of the day to full
sunlight. Sun-ray health lamps are always operating in every room and
within the air conditioning unit to destroy all microbes that happen
to evade our other guards. These lamps are in every living, work and
office room.</p>

<p>"The comforts of our home equal those in all the homes of our
citizens from the first to the tenth grade degree. All the furniture,
furnishings, clothes, even paper are fire-proof. By our process we
fire-proof 100% all inflammable materials, including even the thickest
of lumber. We take no risk of destruction by fire. We do not need a
fire department, nor firemen. We do not allow conditions to exist to
which Earth people are accustomed. I find that in your <i>Brick and
Clay Record Magazine</i>, February 1947 issue:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Last year you built in the United States a half million permanent
homes, but at the same time 400,000 were burned down or damaged, and
this situation is going to get worse. You are building tinder boxes
and firetraps at the greatest rate in your history and with the
encouragement of your government. And this is in the face of some of
the worst fire disasters you have ever known.</p>

<p>"Your fire losses last year were up 30%. They cost 11,000 lives. They
wasted $500,000,000. You burned to death 3,000 children in their
homes. Yet your Federal Government is encouraging, even subsidizing
the building of homes, virtually every part of which above the ground,
including the interior wall finish, is combustible. When fire hits
such homes they will burn so fast the occupants won't have time to
save themselves, let alone the home."<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>"New York (AP)—Fire losses in the United States reached an appalling
all time high of $700,000,000 this year."<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>He led me through their living room, bedrooms, library, fumigating and
disinfecting closets, toilet and shower closets without bathtubs. When
I asked him about the tubs, he said bathtubs were not used on Mars, as
they were unsanitary and unsafe.</p>

<p>We then went into their spacious dining room, where Mrs. Savona was
arranging the table. "I have arranged to serve luncheon in privacy
here; this room is thought transmission proof, so we can freely talk.
I want you to be comfortable. Our guest room is ready for you. You can
occupy it as long as you are on this planet. Mr. Savona and Xora will
keep you busy showing you around. In a few days you will find your way
by yourself, and you will be able to locate and visit your fellow Earth
men."</p>

<p>Passing through the dining room, we went into the kitchen, which had
all kinds of improved machines to help make kitchen work more efficient
and pleasant. Walls, floors, and ceilings were of glossy white. But
there was no sink. I asked about it.</p>

<p>"In our small homes we did away with that drudgery and servants long
ago. Our dishes and silverware are cleaned at our central dishwashing
department."</p>

<p>He led me to a closet with a continuous moving escalator dumb-waiter.
"After our meal we place our dishes, silverware, and glassware, all of
which have our name and number, on trays going down. When they reach
the bottom, they automatically land on a conveyor belt which takes them
directly to the central dishwashing and sterilizing machine; they come
back, clean and sanitary, the same way."</p>

<p>"What do you do with your garbage and rubbish?"</p>

<p>He took hold of the knob of a small door in the wall beside the dumb
waiter.</p>

<p>"Oh," I said, "that's your incinerator."</p>

<p>"No," he replied, "we do not burn such valuable materials. We put our
garbage into paper bags, seal it, and throw it into this opening. It
reaches a garbage car which takes it to a large factory where it is
turned into fertilizer. Our rubbish is wrapped up and sent down the
dumb-waiter. The belt conveyor takes it to the assorting room, and
again by belt conveyors for long distances to our factories. Very
little is wasted.</p>

<p>"The kitchen in our home is seldom used. Underneath the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span> court there
is a large central kitchen, where any housewife can have her dinner
cooked. She either just brings her raw food to the chef, or gives him
directions over the phone, telling him for how many people and the time
to be served. If the chef needs raw foods, he sends to the commissary
department.</p>

<p>"The commissary department supplies foods and beverages to all the
residents of a community of five or more courts. It is also an ordering
and receiving station from our main depots, which you have seen from
the air. Daily supplies are shipped from the depot by our underground
freight cars. Emergency shipments are made by messenger planes."</p>

<p>"Does the commissary department ever run short of supplies because of
an unusual demand?" I asked.</p>

<p>"If it does, it can then requisition from another nearby department,"
he answered. "If people are inclined to be gluttonous, and it happens
at times, even here, we ration them. That situation doesn't arise
frequently, however, and when it does, we study the individual to find
out what causes this unhealthy habit and help him to eliminate it.
Individuals are very quickly cured from such an unhealthy inclination.</p>

<p>"In the court along the kitchen, there is a public dining room where
each family has a permanently reserved table. Menus are made up
daily, by competent dietitians, who offer nourishing dishes adapted
to the special needs of age, activity, and physical condition of the
individual. When we wish a specially cooked dinner, we must notify our
chef about the change of our menu. Sometimes my wife cooks a special
dinner herself, in one of the small kitchenettes adjoining this large
kitchen. It is only when we have special company that we dine in our
homes."</p>

<p>Mrs. Savona announced luncheon. A metal cooker on the table did the
roasting right in front of us by electronic high frequency short wave
radio. The heat generated in the food cooked it in seconds. It was
so wonderfully flavored and tasty that I enjoyed several helpings.
I complimented my hostess on her good cooking, asking her if all
housewives on Mars were such good cooks.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, and some are better. A great many are specialists in the
different branches of culinary arts. But we all stress a wholesome
diet. All our girls must take courses in home economics as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span> well as
in practical nursing, pediatrics, and at what you call baby sitting;
they are frequently called to care for children when their parents
go out. We all get, in our court, a week's turn to work and help in
our kitchen. Kitchens in every court are operated by the residents,
other residents operate our dining rooms; but it is all done under the
supervision of our chef and head waiter.</p>

<p>"We live in what you earth people would call a community style. Every
community has five or six courts, as you must have seen from the air,
laid out in cluster near each other. The young couples like ourselves
who bring up families and who need more rooms occupy single homes or
two family homes. The four-story apartment houses, which surround the
larger courts, are occupied by people who have already raised their
families and who need less space.</p>

<p>"Every community has its preliminary school, hospital, and with
provisions for one bed for every twenty persons and one physician for
every fifty adults or twenty-five couples and their families in the
community. There are also a drug store, theatre, moving picture and
television house, gymnasium, dance hall, for the young boys and girls,
social clubs for the young and the aged, music band, skating rink
during the winter, and indoor and outdoor playgrounds for the very
young children. Of course, there is constant intermingling, between
those living in adjoining and other communities.</p>

<p>"We also have our own court of justice presided over by a conciliator
chosen from our retired aged residents every year. This court settles
our personal disputes. If we wish, we can call in an outside impartial
arbitrator. We also have in this city a superior court of appeal,
presided over by ten retired, aged Martians who are elected by all our
city residents for a four year term. Anyone can appeal his case and get
a hearing. Our court, comparable to your Supreme Court, is also located
in Amboria."</p>

<p>Mrs. Savona addressed Xora. "Do not forget that after the next two
weeks you will take your turn as nurse's aide in the hospital. You
had better make the most of your time now in showing around our Earth
guest."</p>

<p>Luncheon over, Xora suggested taking a walk. "It's a favorite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
diversion of ours," she said. "You can more readily observe our ground
surface while we are strolling."</p>

<p>We went into a spacious outside court with trees, and close cut lawns.
She led me out of the court through an opening in a beautifully
trimmed hedge which she told me surrounded the five or six courts
forming their community. Beyond the hedge, running east and west, one
hundred fifty feet away, was another hedge. The space between was a
street without sidewalks. Along the hedges on both sides were lines of
beautifully shaped shade trees, at equal distances from each other,
carefully pruned to allow shade as well as sunshine and beauty. There
were comfortable benches under them. Parallel to both hedges were two
twenty-five foot strips of beautiful green lawns in lieu of sidewalks.
Between these strips were two twenty-five foot pathways, paved with
a cork or ocean tree lumber surface, easy and resilient to walk on.
In the center and between these pathways was a fifty foot wide full
length flower bed with passages every 200 feet leading to fountains
and statues in the midst of the flower beds. Happy couples, both young
and old, strolled arm in arm or sat on the comfortable benches. The
sweet scents of beautiful flowers, the freshness of vegetation, and the
pleasant chirping of birds were unspoiled by traffic, and industrial
noises. At the end of these hedges, we came to a very wide cross street
or avenue, lined with pruned and beautifully shaped shade trees. It
seemed as if every street had its own style of trees.</p>

<p>I asked Xora, "I noticed from the air the absence of vehicles on your
streets, and I see none now; don't you use your streets even for
deliveries?"</p>

<p>"No, all our traffic for deliveries and collections is done
underground. To avoid accidents, individuals are forbidden to drive
vehicles on the streets or to walk in our subways. Nor are children
allowed to ride bicycles on the surface as they do on earth. We have
no streets, as you call them. We call them parkways, and they are used
exclusively for our pedestrians, who can walk, rest, and cross in
perfect safety, even in the dark."</p>

<p>"Then you have no street accidents, and even an unattended blind man
can safely at any time cross your parkways in any part of your city?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, "providing he knows directions and carries a blind
man's feeling compass."</p>

<p>It was a relief to cross safely without trying to find traffic
lights, or stopping to look both ways for approaching automobiles.
My precautions in crossing remained with me for some time, to the
merriment of Martians with whom I happened to be walking. However, back
here in New York I have almost been run over several times because of
my forgetfulness. I did not see a street policeman there of any kind; a
fact which impressed me then, and occurred to me later. What a relief
not to have to run across streets dodging automobiles and fire engines!
The indescribable pleasure of children playing and the birds twittering
added to my feeling. I was in a land of enchantment.</p>

<p>In the center of the crossroads was an attractive pavilion with awnings
all around it, and with dainty little umbrella tables outside. Many
people were sitting around the tables with refreshments. Xora led me
to a vacant one where a courteous attendant seated us and gave us a
menu with a list of all kinds of ice creams, drinks, fruits, cakes, and
dainty candies. My companion gave the order, after translating the menu
for me. Everyone enjoyed these simple refreshments in a happy orderly
manner. No barkeepers, with their noisy customers guzzling alcoholic
drinks, no disgusting drunkards, no promiscuous petting, no attempt at
pick-ups, no vulgarity, and no high class "Cafe Society."</p>

<p>In a very comfortable corner spot, there were about five vacant tables
decorated with pennants on top of the umbrella poles. I asked Xora why
these tables were vacant. She said they were reserved for the over-aged
and high ranking members and their immediate families. So were the best
seats in all public assemblies. Others had to take seats according to
their rank and grade degree. Her family had to take balcony seats,
because neither of her parents had as yet reached higher than the fifth
grade.</p>

<p>Bowls of beautiful fresh, conserved, and dried fruits and nuts of many
varieties were placed on our table. Xora said they were not the best of
their kind. The choicest food from the commissary and the best articles
from the general stores were first allotted to the crippled, the
disabled, the sick, the aged, and the high ranking members and their
families.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>Momentarily forgetting what her grandfather had told me, I reached into
my pocket for some gold pieces to pay for the refreshments. She started
to laugh and said there was no payment.</p>

<p>"In that event," I said, "I can sit here all day and gorge these, and
go to other pavilions when the supply here is low."</p>

<p>"You can do that," she said, "but you will soon become satiated and
you will not take advantage of such privilege. It's only the small
children who are tempted to partake of more than is good for them. They
are not served without their parents, and they are taught restraint.
These pavilions are at every crossing and are supplied continually by
one of the four adjoining communities for a week each in their turn.
Each community tries to outdo the other in quality and service, so
as to attract more guests. Pavilions and benches on all our streets
contribute a great deal to our social intermingling, especially during
the afternoon teas."</p>

<p>"To whom are all these refreshments charged? There must be an enormous
supply consumed daily."</p>

<p>"They are charged against the account of public supply," she answered.</p>

<p>"Is there no payment for anything you get here?"</p>

<p>"No! It certainly looks very droll to us when we observe your payments,
your nuisance taxes and all other taxes and licenses you impose on your
citizens.</p>

<p>"Think of your federal, state, county, and city taxes, your licenses,
assessments, permits, and tariffs. How about your large army of
salespeople, cashiers, bookkeepers, examiners, accountants, and others?
Cash registers and office machinery and other derivative occupations
pertaining to your money handling, including your assessors, collectors
and other employees, all wasting their time in these your boundless
non-productive occupations."</p>

<p>For a minute I didn't answer. Then I commented, "your street cleaners
certainly keep your streets in perfect condition. I see no dust,
rubbish, leaves, or papers flying around."</p>

<p>"Of course not," she answered in an offended manner. "We have no street
cleaners, no garbage collectors who, like your Earth ones, collect
rubbish and openly spill it into their wagons, fouling the air of the
whole street for the passersby. Our volunteer gardeners prune our trees
and shrubberies, cut and trim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span> our hedges and lawns, and plant and keep
our flower beds. They have up-to-date tools and machinery, as well as
strong vacuum pumps to take up the dust, and dead leaves from lawns
and walks. The leaves are used for fertilizer. They take great pride
in their work, and each group tries to outdo the other in keeping the
parkways and streets clean and beautiful. In the winter time we have
no snow, ice accumulations, or slippery walks, because they all are
provided with hot water pipes below the surface."</p>

<p>"I have not seen a foot policeman anywhere. Don't you have them, or
need them?"</p>

<p>"We do not need them," she replied, "with the exception of a few as
directors of air traffic, and one in every court of justice. Neither
do we have or tolerate your tyrannical secret police, or investigating
agents. Have you noticed that we have no locks on our doors or latches
on our windows? No one possesses anything that someone else would take
away or could not obtain himself. We have nothing of such value that it
has to be hidden under lock and keys, put into safes or safe deposit
boxes, or protected by burglar alarms."</p>

<p>"I am surprised," I told her, "that I haven't seen any people of
another race on your walks or in your pavilion. There were many blue
and green Martians on your grandfather's flight ship. Would you serve
any of them at this pavilion?"</p>

<p>She answered with astonishment, "Why not? They would receive the same
service you had."</p>

<p>"Do they live in separate quarters in this city?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, they don't live among us. But those that visit us, or are
tourists or members of our council, reside here temporarily with us.
They, with their families, occupy some of the best suites in our
largest and best hotels, where travelers and tourists from other cities
and continents of all races reside while in Amboria. They mingle freely
with us, without discrimination, mainly in the center of the city. When
we visit there, you will see many of them."</p>

<p>"You mean that only the people of the white race are permanent
residents of this city?"</p>

<p>"You seem surprised. You're probably judging us by Earth standards.
There, even good citizens supposedly, calling themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span> Christians,
practice forms of discrimination. They have no tolerance of other
religious faiths; no tolerance of racial groups. Even in social life,
clubs and other organizations by gentleman's agreement exclude certain
races and creeds. In business a man's ability counts less than his
social connections. This to us seems unfair."</p>

<p>"But how can you eliminate such castes," I asked. "You have your
principles of democracy," she answered. "If your people would follow
them, even follow the principles of their religious creeds sincerely,
intolerance, injustices, and bigotry would soon vanish.</p>

<p>"I have learned in school the history of Earth through moving pictures
taken from our television. We've used television for thousands of
years. We actually see what has happened and what is now happening
on your Earth. We have no white supremacy. Our white race has never
wanted to enslave, exploit or govern our other races. We have no
underprivileged groups of our own or any race. We have found it best
for every race to permanently occupy and reside within the continent
and climate where nature originally planted it and to have its own
territory and sphere of influence. It takes all our races combined to
amicably govern the inhabitants of our planet; we cooperate with each
other, and compete in our achievements, for the benefit of us all. All
our continents and races are amicably and completely interdependent.</p>

<p>"Scientists, inventors, students, and teachers of one race often attend
universities of other races to learn of their new discoveries and
improved methods and mechanics. Ideas, information, and even machines
are freely exchanged between our races. We equally share with other
continents and races those natural, mineral, and other products, that
we have, and they need. They do the same with us. We even ration among
us the scarce products. Unlike your greedy nations, we do not forcibly
grab or extort from other continents.</p>

<p>"Each race has its own schools of all types, cultural, professional and
trade.</p>

<p>"There is equal representation in our Supreme Government Council. The
President of our Council, or of Mars, can be either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span> male or female and
of any race. In fact, quite often our President is not of the white
race.</p>

<p>"Our other races are just as careful and as proud to maintain their
purity of race as we are. Our laws in that respect are very strict all
over Mars. All of us up to the tenth grade degree, including adult
children of Sun-Rank members, on this globe have the same standard of
living, and we are happy together; difference in race is no problem to
us."</p>

<p>"I certainly am impressed," I answered, "you people certainly solved
that problem easily. You have done away with intolerance, and all the
grievances of discrimination. Tell me more about your governing class."</p>

<p>"We have no class or racial distinction, no titled nobility, no high
and low castes of society, no dollar aristocracies, no so-called upper
classes, and no retired rich idlers nor jobless poor ones.</p>

<p>"We have one governing upper class, our aged citizens. They have the
intelligence and wisdom that come from maturity and experience. They
act on committees of conciliation and arbitration between workers,
foremen and executives. If their physical and mental abilities show a
natural decline with age, they apply and are elected to the more easy
government and municipal offices, according to their capabilities. Our
factories have separate apprentice craft training and finishing school
shops, where productive speed is non-existent. The shops are staffed by
our qualified aged, as teachers. Skilled aged workers are frequently
used for precision work.</p>

<p>"By this method, we are able to keep our older people busy and
contented. They give us the best of their experience as long as they
feel able to do so. They keep their self-respect as useful citizens.</p>

<p>"They are our government elected executives, and officials. They are
selected and nominated by their parties, and elected by the people, as
an honor, and as a duty. But only of those who have not reached the
Sun-Rank degrees. Sun-Rank degree members do not and are not allowed
to occupy these offices. A government office with us in an honorary
position without any extra emoluments. Whereas on your earth very
often loyal party members<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span> and those who liberally contribute to its
political campaigns reach and get lucrative offices, and favors."</p>

<p>"How about political parties?" I asked.</p>

<p>"In every one of our races we have sometimes as many as five political
parties, although we don't make a career of politics. Government
executives and officials are not allowed to influence or bring pressure
in favor of or against candidates.</p>

<p>"Because of our system, we don't need homes for the aged, where every
day some of the inmates die, and where they talk of death and plan and
prepare for it years in advance. We give them a full life. They do
not sit around stagnating. They are carefully watched by our medical
department. Our aim is to have them live the longest possible time and
not get tired of it. Thus, most of them live longer than they would
otherwise, and die in harness. Our love and respect for them intensify
our desire to have our aged parents, relations, and all others live
their full life span. They are no burden to us, and we have nothing
to gain by their early death. We are not like some of you on Earth,
eagerly looking forward to their demise to inherit their fortune. All
soft jobs, as you call them, such as employment bureaus, government and
municipal libraries, museums, and other public offices are exclusively
directed and staffed by them. These appointments are made on a merit
basis only. To the contrary, in your country; so many high and low
positions are filled from the ranks of the politically faithful.</p>

<p>"We on Mars are wondering why your government has created what you call
the <i>Federal Old Age and Survivors Insurance</i>, through your Social
Security Boards, for your old people; and then provide them with such a
small pension. Not only are the old people neglected, it seems to us,
but money which could help them is lavishly spent on sumptuous Social
Security Board offices staffed by young, and high salaried officials."</p>

<p>By this time my mind was alert. I listened even more carefully as she
summed up her argument.</p>

<p>"We know you have many healthy, self-respecting, sagacious old people
who would fill all those positions better and, I dare say, more
efficiently. At the same time, while thus employed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span> they would save
your Social Security Board a great deal in old age security payments."</p>

<p>We were thus absorbed in our conversation at the pavilion. Now she
arose and asked me if I were ready to take a brisk ten mile walk to the
center of the city. "We all walk at least five or ten miles a day, rain
or shine."</p>

<p>I was surprised. "Don't you find taking such long walks harmful to your
feet?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she said, "on the contrary, it makes them stronger. It's
exhilarating and invigorating to walk and breathe fresh air. We enjoy
our walks because our shoes are comfortable and soft inside, and do not
deform our feet. They are made to order from lasts of perfect molds of
our feet and fit their functional requirements in motion. In fact, with
few exceptions, all our garments are and must be soft and loose, so as
not to create pressure, or friction to our skin. We believe in plenty
of exercise. Our women do not need, or use your corsets and your other
body torturing contraptions.</p>

<p>"While we walk, I shall try my best to explain to you the layout of
our city. This city, between its east and west rivers, is a little
more than twenty-five terrestrial miles wide. Let us call the pathways
running east and west, streets, and those running north and south,
avenues. They run parallel and at equal distances from each other. All
our communities cover equal surface space, a square fifteen hundred
by fifteen hundred terrestrial feet or 2,250,000 square feet. All the
communities except those adjoining the center oval are bordered into
exact squares by hedges, even though the buildings within may be laid
out in different shapes, so as to make the entire plan symmetrical and
harmonious.</p>

<p>"In the exact center of the city we have a large oval running north
and south. This oval is about five miles wide at the center and
narrows down at both ends to less than a mile; its full length is
twenty miles. The center part is the active spot. I know what you are
thinking—factories, office buildings, business houses. Oh, no. A few
of our manufacturing plants are across the rivers, but all of them are
located on our planet nearest to their natural sources of production,
as you already have been told."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>We were so intent in our conversation that I was surprised when she
told me that we had reached the center. I have seldom on earth covered
such a distance in such a short time. I did not feel tired; it was a
pleasure to walk on the resilient pavements.</p>

<p>We were at the edge of a large lake where a great many people
were resting, sitting alongside or rowing in all kinds of boats.
Rainbow-colored fishes, of sizes up to 18 inches, freely and fearlessly
and swiftly glided in the water among all kinds of beautiful swimming
birds.</p>

<p>Xora pointed to an island in the center of the lake with a very large
pavilion. "Our Symphony Orchestra plays there in the late afternoon
tea period, and after dinner in the evening. This lake-shore is very
popular with our people. Others in their homes or sick in hospitals
hear it over their radios.</p>

<p>"There are three large artificial lakes here. The round center one is
the largest. The two oval ones at each end are both larger than your
New York Central Park. In the winter time they are covered with young
and old people skating and playing ice games. All about the edges of
this center are located our libraries, museums, opera houses, theatres,
hotels, stadiums, universities, theological seminary, dance halls,
and public buildings, as well as the stately building of our Supreme
Council of the Planet Mars."</p>

<p>"Where are your temples of worship, and to what kind of religion do you
people profess?"</p>

<p>"Our temples for religious services are located in this city within
this center. In our monotheistic religion we are not like you on Earth
with your many religious faiths which cause disruptions."</p>

<p>So I said, "I recall reading an article by Rev. Harry Emerson Fosdick,
in which he said we must face the fact that religion has helped make
the world a mess. Fosdick is a well-known writer and thinker. He said
that religious differences and prejudices set man against man. Instead
of unifying mankind, religion seems to divide it."<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>"That's very true," Xora replied. "And at the same time your Earth
babel of over 2,500 languages divide your people too. Here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span> in Mars
with a universal language and a universal deity we can come close to
the ideal of man understanding man."</p>

<p>"What kind of athletic games do you people indulge in?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Now coming back to this center; at both ends and middle sides of it,
we have large stadiums, each seating one hundred thousand persons. We
have games like your football, baseball, basketball, tennis, running,
figure skating, hockey. We also have our own body flying stunts, for
physical upbuilding and enjoyment. Large exhibitions, performances,
and circuses often take place here, but with no brutal, hazardous and
dangerous feats, such as your boxing, wrestling, high trapeze swinging,
wire rope walking, rodeos, bull fighting, or wild animal training
spectacles.</p>

<p>"Now, during our summer or early fall, it is not so crowded here.
This is our vacation and traveling period. Many people frequent the
seashores and the river beaches on both sides of Amboria."</p>

<p>I asked her, "Do you allow swimming in those rivers with all your city
sewers flushing into them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she replied. "We are allowed to swim only in ocean or river
waters, where there are constant water changes, and not in rivers
where waters are used for drinking, and not, as you Earth people
do, in swimming pools. Moreover, our city sewers from toilets, and
dishwashing machines do not run into our rivers; they are too valuable
to be wasted. The sewerage is run or pumped to large reservoirs with
our garbage. The solid matter is taken out and reprocessed into
fertilizers, and the liquids are pumped to fertilize our deserts and
other lands that need it.</p>

<p>"The clean rain water washing down from roofs of buildings through our
rain spouts goes into another sewer line which spills it far out into
the ocean; the rain water from our streets is absorbed by the soil of
our lawns. We do not allow the pollution of our fresh river drinking
waters or our ocean beaches. Not like on your Earth where many drinking
water sources are simply open sewers, with one town drinking sewage
from the next upriver town. One of the worst offenders is New York. It
empties millions of gallons of inadequately treated sewage into the
harbor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span> each day, consequently it makes swimming at nearby beaches
risky.</p>

<p>"Neither do we allow the pollution of our fresh air, as you Earth
people do with your sewage, gases permeating the air on your streets
and through roof vent pipes. These gases are absorbed by our vacuum
pumps and made use of either as fertilizers or as other elements.</p>

<p>"We have read how you Earth people are made ill from poisonous fumes
that permeate the air in all your manufacturing cities. Los Angeles
with its smog is one of the worst offenders. We know that chimney soot
definitely produces cancer and that asthmatics' hearts give out because
they can scarcely breathe when the air is thick with smog."</p>

<p>I asked her, "Don't the workers at these sewer pumps and fertilizing
plants feel a strong aversion for their work?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary," she answered, "for these services we have a long
waiting list of applicants from our most brilliant young volunteers.
Some of them have made very meritorious achievements, and a few have
reached our rank degrees. A youth is disgraced and ostracized by our
girls who does not put in his full volunteer year working diligently at
what you Earth people call the lowest menial occupations.</p>

<p>"The youth who does the most menial work is the one we admire the most,
and the one we consider most honorable. Why should it be menial, when
after all, it is a mutual human service? We give to each other, to the
healthy and to the sick, service for their comforts. Would you call the
duties of mothers, nurses or physicians menial?</p>

<p>"We are shocked and amazed to see on your Earth so many of your young,
healthy, robust, energetic young men who without pride or shame are
engaged in many non-productive occupations as well as in some which are
detrimental to the rest of you. Our youths, in fact all our workers,
would indignantly spurn such employments.</p>

<p>"Nor would any of our youths marry a young lady who did not put in her
volunteer year as practical, probation, and aid nurse in our hospitals.</p>

<p>"All these menial duties are done only by our young; these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span> menial
duties are not so unpleasant as you may think. With our improvements in
automatic machinery, pumps, and vacuum cleaners, there is little direct
handling. Sanitary gloves and breathing masks are worn when working at
malodorous duties; thereby we are completely protected from dirt and
contamination."</p>

<p>All this conversation was certainly amazing to me. Finally, however,
Xora returned to explaining the city's plan to me.</p>

<p>"Let us go back to our city plan, I want to explain to you so that you
will be able soon to get around by yourself and find your Earth friends.</p>

<p>"This oval, which, as you know, we call the center, divides our city
from north to south in half, with one part east of it, and the other
part west of it. The street number system is similar to yours in part
of New York. It is in Martian and not in your roman or arabic numbers.
Communities along the center east start with No. 1, First Street. First
Street begins at the most southern point near the ocean and runs north,
and all the other streets are parallel to it. Buildings around the
center are numbered, beginning at the southern end with No. 1, Center
Street East and No. 1, Center Street West, and going northward on both
sides.</p>

<p>"I have another surprise for you. For the last thousand years, our
forebears have anticipated that we would be able to carry off a
number of Earth men to our planet. Whenever they started to travel in
airplanes through the stratosphere. That is the reason we planned this
city when it was recently constructed, in this simple pattern. When
the Earth men came, we thought they could find their way about more
easily. We do not need such careful marking places for we are like some
of your animals, birds and fish. Your homing pigeon can find its home
from long distances; so can your fish, and often your dog, cat, and
horse. They have an acute development of the sense of direction, and so
have we. From land, sea, or in the air, we can easily find our way and
destination. When we are back home, you will no doubt receive letters
from your friends with their addresses. Would you be able to find them
now?"</p>

<p>"Of course I could, quite easily, when I have mastered your number
system; but if they live at distant points, I will have to travel. Will
you at first take me until I can find my own way?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, I shall be happy to," she replied. "In the meantime, I want you
to know that my father has made an application for a license for you.
You will soon be called to our traffic bureau and instructed how to
operate our planes, and about our traffic rules. When you have mastered
both, you may select your plane and travel about by yourself. For short
distances, we either walk or use underground conveyances. Now we will
ride back to my home by underground.</p>

<p>"Our subway transits cover most of our city, going north and south and
east and west; every community has its stop-offs, both for freight and
for passenger trains."</p>

<p>We were by now on the same street as the community court. We went down
the escalator at the corner to the passenger train platform. In place
of a ticket window, a trestle, or a coin deposit slot, I saw a very
pleasingly decorated space with comfortable seats, an attendant who
was very anxious to make us comfortable, and clean comfort stations,
which we could safely use without the fear of being bludgeoned and
robbed. The train soon arrived; the conductor with courtesy led us to
two individual seats similar to those in our Pullman cars. Each seat
had a little stand or table upon which were the latest magazines and
newspapers. But we were interested in our conversation, and paid no
attention to the news of the day.</p>

<p>Xora showed me a daily bulletin printed by her community. She told me
that every zone in every city has its own daily newspaper and radio
station. I examined it with interest. The east side of this city was
divided into three zones, and so was the west side. There were also
general dailies for every race on the planet covering all of the globe
news or intercontinental happenings without any display, classified or
other advertisements.</p>

<p>"We have full liberty of the press, radio, pictures and television,"
Xora said. "Our government has no right to censor them unless for
unmoral causes. Otherwise their freedom is inviolable. We are at
liberty to think, talk, broadcast, write about, and criticize our
government executives, or our political, and economic defects, from the
highest to the lowest, and state our opinions without reservation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>"We give and accept criticism in a friendly spirit, but we are very
careful not to make libelous statements."</p>

<p>We had now reached our community, and the conductor signaled for a
stop. He led us out to a platform near their commissary department,
a very large store with food and beverage of every kind displayed on
white monel shelves. Inside the spic and span interiors were attendants
busy taking care of their customers.</p>

<p>I again said, "During my short visit here I cannot help but observe
everywhere the unusual cleanliness in your homes, on your walks, in
your station, and on your subway cars, and in the neat appearance of
all your people, both young and old. It seems to be an inborn habit of
you people of Mars. How did it begin?"</p>

<p>"Thousands of years back, our ancestors inaugurated these exacting
rules by strictly enforcing them first by educational methods. We learn
them through our boards of education in childhood and later, through
our boards of health, who enforce them by regular inspections of our
homes, offices, and factories, and punishing us by demoting us a point
or more, according to infractions. So now it has, as you said, become a
natural habit with us."</p>

<p>Then Xora said to me, "This experience today has no doubt been a very
exciting adventure for you. You had better retire to your room for
relaxation and meditation."</p>

<p>I agreed that I was indeed astonished at what I had heard and seen of
the ways and conditions of Martian life.</p>

<p>She answered that this was only the beginning. "Grandfather wishes to
see you again one day this week, and you will be amazed at what he has
to show and tell you."</p>

<p>"It is certainly wonderful, wonderful beyond conception," was all I
could answer. From the bird's-eye and surface views I have seen of the
city, I could judge that its planners certainly had done a good job in
its layout. Let me say again, it was beautiful beyond comparison. It
would take me too long to give an adequate description that would do it
justice.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><i>Old Age Dependents</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">For more</span> than a month the Lieutenant was absent from his parkway bench,
but he corresponded with me from different cities. One day, after
his return, I met him by appointment at the usual place. I found him
dejected.</p>

<p>Greeting me, he said, "I am sorry for this delay. I tried to persuade
my local board to change my classification. I wanted to get back into
the service, but they refused me. I went to Washington. There I am
classified as harmless but incurably insane, and my request was refused.</p>

<p>"Since then I have been traveling from city to city, observing our
manner of living from a different perspective. Prior to my trip to
Mars, my attitude toward the misery of life here was the same as that
of all us Earth people, apathetic, or calloused, stone-hearted. I
looked upon misery without pity, accepting it as a matter of course and
feeling fortunate that I was better off. I am now intensely suffering
an extreme living change contrast reaction, of our world against the
one on Mars, and I can't adapt myself to our conditions.</p>

<p>"I cannot help comparing our shameful existence here with the happy
way of living on Mars. I am sad and miserable when I see and read here
everywhere, every day, of the unhappy existence of our fellow man."
Then he handed me his diary with the notes he had entered while roaming
around in our eastern cities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>"One day on the sidewalk of a busy shopping district, in front of a
large store in one of the cities, a legless man sitting on a platform
about six inches above the sidewalk level was propelling himself with
one hand and holding a rope leading to a small monkey with the other.
He was trying to sell shoelaces and pencils, which he carried in a
cigar box on his platform. Passersby were handing their contribution to
the monkey without taking his merchandise.</p>

<p>"In another shopping district, an armless man carried a small showcase
with notions strapped over his neck and about his shoulders, with
a sign calling attention to his infirmity and asking the public to
purchase from him.</p>

<p>"In the coldest and stormiest days and nights, on slippery icy streets,
shivering women with their babies, and old men and women, some blind,
others so weak they could scarcely walk, were trying to sell newspapers
or other articles. Or they were playing an antiquated musical
instrument. There was always the small tin cup for contributions.</p>

<p>"In my ramblings, I purposely entered into conversation with many of
these unfortunates. At 3:00 A.M., on a very dark, cold morning I had
an occasion to pick up an old charwoman who had slipped on the icy
pavement. When I asked her why she was out so early, she said that
she worked nights in a bank, cleaning and scrubbing. She lives with
a widowed daughter who works during the day. She takes care of her
children and also contributes to the upkeep of the home from her meager
earnings. She told me that most charwomen are old; and they, with the
old men, are the all-night army doing the cleaning and scrubbing in
banks, business houses, offices, and factory buildings. They are all
only too glad to get and keep these jobs.</p>

<p>"An hour later, I met at a corner a bent, very old newspaper vendor.
After buying a paper, I asked him why he was out so early on the
street. He told me that he had the concession to sell early morning
newspapers on that corner. Many of his customers were either night
workers going home, or early workers going to their jobs.</p>

<p>"Arriving in this city that same evening, I saw near the New York
Central Station, an old man, shabbily dressed in a light-weight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span> torn
overcoat, shivering as he looked into a restaurant window as if he
were hungry and hadn't the price of a meal. Stepping to his side, I
invited him to join me as my guest for dinner. He weakly refused; but I
prevailed upon him, and he reluctantly walked in with me arm in arm. I
assured him that it would give me great pleasure to have his company.</p>

<p>"He was cultured and expressed himself with intelligence. I told him I
was just adventuring, trying to gain friendship with men of his wisdom
and long experience in order to learn their reactions to our way of
life."</p>

<p>He said, "I have my own philosophy with strong opinions. I may offend
you by intensely criticizing conditions!"</p>

<p>I begged him to go ahead, for I wanted to hear his philosophy. He said,
"From the time we take on family responsibilities, we all fear two
afflictions. One is the future breaking up of our intimate family after
our children have left us. The other is our fear of old age, want, and
dependence.</p>

<p>"You, our children, before your birth fed from your mother's body. You
were born through her life and death struggles. You were nursed from
her breasts until at times she felt faint. You kept her awake at night
and gave her no rest during the day. She mothered you, nourished you,
and nursed you day and night during your sicknesses. Watching over you
like a guardian angel, she gave you her mother love, affection, and
protection.</p>

<p>"You took all the necessities, and even the luxuries your father
offered you, always desiring more, never questioning how difficult it
was to provide them. He worked willingly day and night to give you
happiness. He gave you his full love, and protection. He sacrificed
his rest and pleasures to guard over you. He provided you with tennis
courts, and when he could, automobiles. He never denied you education
or necessities. When he could, he gave you greater luxuries. He
surrounded you with servants, nursemaids, and governesses. For your
enjoyment, he gave you the most expensive toys, ponies, and all your
heart's desires. For your social contacts and for your health, he sent
you for entire summers to the seashore, farm, or mountains.</p>

<p>"Some of us parents have done a great deal for you, others less.
Nevertheless, most of us gave all we could afford. We may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span> have been a
bit severe at times in disciplining you, but it was for your own good.
Your happiness and security always came first.</p>

<p>"The natural law of reproduction is inexorable, and among animals the
parental feeling is not so developed as it is among human beings.
Just as soon as animal offspring are physically able to shift for
themselves, they are abandoned. But it is not so among us intelligently
developed human beings.</p>

<p>"You cannot hide behind the saying that since you did not ask us to
bring you into the world, we are not your responsibility; therefore,
you are released from any moral obligation to us. No, you are
accountable to us, and you should justly return the love, affection,
and protection that we bestowed upon you.</p>

<p>"We did not abandon you. Instead, you left us against our inward wishes
to start your own family. You know we greatly miss your presence,
your voice, and news from you and yours. Our parental love for you is
just as keen now as when you were babies; we are just as anxious now
for your welfare as we always were, even though you no longer live
with us. It is now so easy and cheap to keep close contact with us,
through rapid transportation, telephone, telegraph, and mail. We want
to hear often from you some of you neglect to answer our letters,
causing us worry and sleepless nights of suffering. When some of you do
answer, you just get your secretary to typewrite a letter for you. We
appreciate more the shortest of letters in your own handwriting.</p>

<p>"I am not criticizing you, sir, or my own children, or any specific
children. I am blaming in general those who are guilty of neglecting
their parents. Furthermore, I am giving you not only my reactions, but
also those of many other parents I know.</p>

<p>"Have you ever missed a lost pet dog? How much more do we miss you, our
own children?</p>

<p>"Now that we are separated, alone, and old, we need you more than ever
to cheer us up before our end. It's a pity that the saying 'out of
sight out of mind' is true with many of our children.</p>

<p>"The other affliction, the apprehension of want and dependence,
is still worse for us. Through family responsibility and other
circumstances beyond our control, most of us could not protect
ourselves against old age dependence by purchasing an annuity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span> or
saving enough money for the 'rainy day.' No one knows the misery of
this affliction until he has experienced it; and no one knows the
bitter feeling of ingratitude, and disillusion better than the helpless
aged.</p>

<p>"Many of those who have outlived their usefulness have no one to help
them. With the petty old age pensions we cannot afford medical and
personal care. Indifferently or apprehensive, we await death.</p>

<p>"As soon as age begins to gray our hair and line our faces, we are
shelved; doors to employment are closed to us, even though we are
healthy and efficient. When infirmity sets in, we seem to become a
burden to some of our children, who quarrel among themselves, trying
to shift the burden of our support. It is still worse when we elect
to live with some of our children. We are treated like burdensome
stepchildren. Whatever we say or don't say, or do or don't do is
wrong; the dog may tear up the house, for he is cute and is petted and
lovingly cared for.</p>

<p>"Many old people whose children do not want them or are unable to help
them, or who have no family, become the dregs of humanity and must
starve or commit suicide. You can find their bodies in the morgues and
on dissecting tables in medical colleges.</p>

<p>"You are probably unaware of the misery of old age dependents. I
can tell you of cases of old parents criminally neglected by their
well-to-do children, many of whom you will find in flophouses and slum
districts of all large cities.</p>

<p>"For the past many years, one of our New York newspapers three weeks
before Christmas has appealed for help for hundreds of the neediest
cases. It exposes to the public the pathetic problems of sickness and
death among people of all ages. Just go on the rounds with a social
worker if you wish to witness the inhumanity of man to man.</p>

<p>"I'm going to tell you something I saw many years ago. A man, deeply
charitable, stood at a spot near Madison Square and Fifth Avenue in
New York every night. There he auctioned off the services of the many
unfortunates. He was always surrounded by them, as well as by a group
of onlookers. He stood these victims, one at a time, on a box which he
called 'the block.' It was pitiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span> to see them standing there, either
flushed and embarrassed, or with tears running down their cheeks. He
then called for bids.</p>

<p>"'What am I offered for this person? Who will give him ten cents?
Twenty-five cents? Fifty cents? Do you have a job for him?' Sometimes
he gave the history of the person with sufficient verification to
substantiate his information. There were always offers of money,
dropped in a glass on the block by the bystanders, many of whom
themselves were in tears. Many of the unfortunates found jobs there.
After the contributions had been made, the speaker counted the money in
the presence of the auctioned persons and gave each its equivalent in
tickets worth fifty cents each. These tickets could be used to procure
beds and meals at specified hotels and restaurants. He kept up this
procedure night after night, until the last member of his flock was
taken care of.</p>

<p>"I well remember one man he put on the block. A bedraggled old
drunkard, wearing oversized garments, torn and patched. He said, 'Look
at this poor man. He looks like an alley cat, doesn't he? Just as if
children threw snowballs at him during the day, and as if he rummaged
through garbage cans at night.'"</p>

<p>My friend paused for a minute in his reminiscences. He was evidently
lost in thought. I had been listening to him with both pity and a
feeling of shame. He evidently had had no opportunity to talk to anyone
for a long time. I could understand his need to unburden himself and
determined to listen to the end without interrupting him. Finally he
began to speak again, at first slowly, and then with passion and force.
"You, who are now guiding our destiny, look about you in this busy hive
of a city and in our entire country at the benefits we have bestowed
upon you everywhere, on land and sea, under and above land and sea.
The beautiful edifices, libraries, homes, department stores, office
buildings and theatres; the transportation and distributive systems;
ships, submarines, subways, busses, automobiles, airplanes and trains,
the creative and destructive inventions; radio, television, radar,
atomic bomb, moving picture; penicillin, and other new curatives and
the thousand discoveries and achievements. All these are for your
benefit, so that you young people can live and enjoy a more healthy and
longer life.</p>

<p>"I can't say that the system of life we inherited and pass on to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span> you
is good. It isn't. But under the circumstances, we have done much
better for you than our parents did for us; and we hope that you will
do even better for your children.</p>

<p>"A great many of us were stunted by lack of play time in our youth; our
education was neglected for necessary labor; but we carefully guarded
you and gave you amusements, and sports for your normal physical,
intellectual and spiritual development. We were the taxpayers who
maintained the city, state, and federal governments. Many of us died in
the terrific pressure and struggle of realizing our aims. A great many
of us passed away in middle age; many of us are in insane asylums; and
those few of us that survived, are now becoming helpless, disabled,
and infirm, <i>secundum naturam</i>. The ravages of nature and time
take many of us early and take a large toll of us over the age of
sixty-five. Our span of life after sixty-five is very short. We die
very rapidly; therefore, our cost and responsibility to you are not
large or long lasting.</p>

<p>"Your duty is to make us happy and comfortable for the few days or
years left to us, if not for love then at least out of gratitude. We
don't want you to have to appear <i>in foro conscientiae</i>, before
the tribunal of conscience, to justify your actions and to try to
attain a future peace of mind.</p>

<p>"An elaborate funeral with flowers, or your lamentations at our death
means nothing to us. But your love, kindness, and generosity to us
while we are alive are most important. We want to die feeling you will
have no cause for remorse over your treatment of us.</p>

<p>"Many of you have accumulated or will inherit large fortunes directly
or indirectly due to our hard work and sacrifices, you accept the
fat of the land as your due and for your own pleasure, without even
gratitude to those few that still live who helped to make your fortune.
Your indifference to our condition is one of the crimes of the ages. We
don't want your charity or money."</p>

<p>At this point I interrupted the old man with a question, "Aren't you
too critical and too severe in your denunciation of children?"</p>

<p>"No, not when I speak of those whom the shoe fits. However, I am not
condemning all children; and in justice to a great many of them, I have
heard of and seen many good children who have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span> taken care of their old
parents. A recent war hero who was given $15,000 by a magazine for his
story immediately placed it as a trust fund for his mother. I know of
others who have helped to finance an income property purchase to help a
father. Others have ruined their future lives and their opportunities
by being saddled with the burden of supporting their parents and
families. Talented children have abandoned their education and training
at an early age to go to work to help support their parents or to
contribute to the upkeep of younger brothers and sisters. Many of them
have been forced to remain old maids and bachelors on account of their
parents.</p>

<p>"Society in the long-run loses in this antiquated practice of shifting
the burden of responsibility to young shoulders. To my mind, the
support of old people is a social problem that should be taken care of
by social security boards. Help and protection from these boards would
rehabilitate families made destitute by the burden. Society as a whole
would greatly benefit by creating new trained members and workers.
Society owes all of us a moral obligation and a just debt. It should
give us compensation, not charity. We ignorant human beings, up to
now, have not made any concerted effort to solve our problem. Yes, a
beginning has been made, but it is inadequate.</p>

<p>"Society has created the federal old age and survivors insurance
operated by the United States government through the Social Security
Board. This means that those few will have something to live on who
have reached the age of sixty-five and are helpless. This is a step
forward, but an insufficient one, for the payments allotted are only
enough to pay the rent of the poorest living quarters. They still keep
us in dependence. Does society or Congress think that the starvation
stipend we are privileged to receive, twenty to sixty-eight dollars and
fifty cents per month, is enough, when according to the present poor
man's standard of living, the minimum living cost is eighteen dollars
per week per person? Many of us self-respecting old persons are still
able to do some kind of work; but because of our age, we are lucky if
we find any. When offered hard, menial, night, graveyard hour services,
we accept them rather than live on the starvation Social<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span> Security
allowances or depend on some of our children or on charity.</p>

<p>"Old people should be guaranteed freedom from want and dependence.
With every worker in this country contributing to Social Security, and
only a small percentage of dependents reaching the qualifying age of
sixty-five, the accumulation of unearned premiums must be enormous.
This surplus should be used to increase the allowances to dependents.
Instead, the government flagrantly uses the major part of this
earmarked money for other purposes.</p>

<p>"All contributions made by us and employers from our weekly wages
for Social Security according to the Brookings Institute report have
accumulated and used as follows:"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Brookings report says these tremendous sums for security
programs ultimately would have to come annually from new taxation,
regardless of the monthly payroll taxes. The proof of this was given
in a Senate speech by Sen. John L. McClennan (D., Ark.). He revealed
that $38,250,000,000 belonging to the present Old Age, Unemployment,
Railroad Retirement, and other such trust funds financed by direct
payroll tax, had been dissipated by the government on a hundred and
one other spending projects."<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>
</div>

<p>"Furthermore, the law should be changed in regard to this $50.00 per
month earnings. It should be at least $75.00 per month. In other words,
an aged person earning $75.00 per month should forfeit the Social
Security pension for the period of his employment.</p>

<p>"Social Security should also provide for the crippled, disabled,
blind, and other handicapped individuals of all ages;—widows and
orphans—should be provided with a reasonable, self-supporting pension.
Furthermore, Social Security should develop into an annuity insurance
for everyone. The amount of payments should be in ratio to the premiums
turned in by the policy holder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>"Workmen's Compensation Insurance should be transferred to Social
Security, and unscrupulous doctors, lawyers, Workmen Compensation
Insurance Companies, undertakers, and other parasites, should not be
allowed to consume the major part of the insurance paid to the worker
who is injured at work.</p>

<p>"Workmen Compensation Insurance Companies, voluntary health
agencies, charitable hospitals, clinics, and welfare services should
be completely abolished. Contributions to them should be legally
forbidden. The contributors to these charitable institutions then could
transfer their financial aid in the form of an extra tax to Social
Security. The work done now by these charitable activities should be
solely handled by Social Security, not as charity, but as a right due
us. Once and for all, we would do away with a deplorable, ancient
custom, the curse of charity which nobody willingly wants. A large part
of voluntary contributions goes for other purposes than to benefit the
beneficiaries.</p>

<p>"All these should come directly under a new system—The Federal Social
Protection and Security Board.</p>

<p>"Your observation of our miseries and destitution should be a warning
to you. Your generation may become the victim of your own neglect and
folly. You have no guarantee that circumstances (may God forbid) will
not become worse for you, and you do not know how your children will
treat you.</p>

<p>"I am appealing to all of you to make a concerted effort to have
Congress change the Social Security Act so that it will perform what
its name means, and let it become a real security for us, for you, and
for your future generations. <i>Fiat justitia ruat caelum</i> (let
justice be done though the heavens fall)."</p>

<p>"Then you are interested only in the aged and the disabled?" I asked
him. He answered, "not at all. We will not have economic safety and
stability until society once and for all seriously starts war against
unemployment, want, and charity.</p>

<p>"The trend nowadays is charged with danger. I dare say, our young
men who have come back from the wars may not be as meek as those who
came back from the last war to face unemployment, street corner apple
selling and poverty. Our veterans today justly demand employment, the
chance to marry, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span> right to a decent livelihood for themselves,
their families, and their parents.</p>

<p>"In my opinion, our large country is still in its infancy; it
has as yet not reached twenty-five per cent of the zenith of its
possible development. With progress in air travel and transportation
distribution, a renaissance of unprecedented prosperity is near and can
quickly be accelerated. We cannot attain this prosperity so long as we
do extravagant things, at public expense.</p>

<p>"Let our government instead take over all private, state, or federal
unproductive lands, whether it is fertile, arid or marsh. Statistics
from the United States Department of Agriculture Bureau of Agriculture
Economics on federal rural lands, on page 7, shows that the federal
lands, swamps and marshes are 3,000,000 acres, barren and brush land
40,000,000 acres, non-forested range land 234,000,000 acres, crop land
4,000,000 acres; that does not include 177,000,000 acres of forest
land, nor does it include the territory of Alaska. It does not include
non-productive state and private lands.</p>

<p>"Let the government start a large scale federal and state works project
to improve these lands, so that they will not only be made productive
but also accessible.</p>

<p>"Let it start an era of colonization, by generously financing on easy
terms all young couples or idle families. Homesteads should be granted
to them under competent supervision. These steps will help to develop
happy, independent, prosperous families, as well as ultimately enrich,
and increase prosperity in the entire nation.</p>

<p>"As we braced ourselves to win the second World war, so can we muster
our resources if we wish, to do away with the outdated system of want
and charity. <i>Coute qui coute</i> (cost what it may). The reason I am
repeating the words <i>want and charity</i> so often is that I want to
strongly impress upon your mind the seriousness of my argument. Whether
the job is done by my plan or any other plan, we can and must make an
end to these conditions.</p>

<p>"Unemployment compensation payments, enough for a livelihood, should be
made and continued until everyone has a living wage job. If necessary,
our government should keep up large public works of constructive
improvement all over the nation."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>Writing down his name and address and giving it to me, he said, "I want
to thank you for your treat. I can tell you more of my ideas, but it
would keep us here for many more hours. It is getting late and I have
to be on my way. If you can write me, I will be glad to meet you again
and continue our discussion."</p>

<p>I put a five dollar bill in his hand, but with tears in his eyes, he
proudly returned it. "I must have bored you with my lengthy discourse,"
he apologized.</p>

<p>I answered, "On the contrary, I have learned a great deal, and I thank
you for all the information and suggestions." We shook hands, and said
good night.</p>

<p>"His conversation gave me more cause for my sadness; I was distressed
to hear of the neglect of our aged people. I felt ashamed of our
mistreatments to the disabled, crippled, and blind.</p>

<p>"During the slow traffic hours in the New York subways, on the
sidewalks, and on this parkway I have closely observed many middle-aged
people with their deformed bodies, swollen legs, and flabby,
loose-skinned masks of faces. All of them in youth must have had
natural beauty. All over the country, inside and outside of bars and
saloons, in slums, in parks, and in alleys, you will find many aged,
middle-aged and even young people who are listless.</p>

<p>"It is unbelievable and shameful that in this country, in our age, with
our phenomenally abundant resources, such conditions should exist.</p>

<p>"There has been famine in India where hundreds and thousands have died
from starvation, and millions of innocent, defenseless Jewish victims
have been exterminated in sadistic orgies. What an existence we are
creating for ourselves and our children. The future generations will
surely pay. The sins of the fathers once more will be visited on the
children."</p>

<p>Every time he handed me one of his chapters, he followed my reading
from his own copy, because many times I would ask questions or start
a discussion. I was wishing that I too should have been present on
Mars. He sensed a certain amount of skepticism that was forming in my
mind, and kept on hoping and assuring me that another opportunity would
present itself for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span> trip to Mars and that I should accompany him.
"You'll see for yourself," he said.</p>

<p>At about this time, he gave vent to his pent-up anger and said, "All
this makes me sick at heart; my soul and mind are filled with disgust
and fear that I am the offspring of an ugly lot of beasts. I don't want
to remain on Earth.</p>

<p>"Millions of our youths have gone to war, and have sacrificed
themselves in one form or another, to make this world a better one.
I hope that they may not only end these problems, but may succeed in
changing the economic life of all of us. If not, they have fought and
died in vain.</p>

<p>"Then, oh, God, Who has given us intelligence which we misuse to
fashion a chain forged with links of gold, which has us so securely
bound and enslaved—far better take away from us that priceless wisdom
which we do not know how to value. Efface it from our minds, so that we
revert to our former primitive state until our present system of life
can be entirely forgotten, and until we become entirely purified from
our crimes. Then, and only then, instill in us a pure civilization, so
that the cursed money system will be no more."</p>

<p>All this he spoke with a strange vehemence and uncontrolled emotion.
He burst out in a loud, passionate sobbing. It took him some time to
compose himself; then he said, "I cannot help my feelings. I am now not
so inured to seeing poverty and want as you all are, or as I was before.</p>

<p>"You must excuse my agitation; it certainly delays the finishing of my
story to you. We had better postpone it until tomorrow, when I hope I
will be more calm."</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Bee Hive</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">When I met</span> the Lieutenant the following day, he smiled somberly.</p>

<p>"My emotional outburst yesterday was a relief to me," he said, "but I
would have preferred having it in privacy. Since I am now calm I have
here a typewritten copy of the narrative of what happened to me at
Amboria, the city on Mars.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>"I don't want to take up your time in giving you a detailed description
of my room. I will leave it to your own imagination that it was more
beautifully decorated and comfortable than any we Earth people can
conceive.</p>

<p>"I was in a daze, pleasantly exhilarated by my strong feeling for Xora,
and utterly bewildered by the wonderful experiences and new ways of
living."</p>

<p>Several sheets of paper on a small table attracted my attention. It
was a message in English from Sun-Rank Banard, saying that my crew
members and I could present ourselves any day that week to the airport
for instruction in flying and traffic rules. There was also on the
table what seemed to be a large Ingersoll pocket watch lying on a
couple of sheets of paper. Picking the watch up, I saw another message,
which stated that the instrument was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span> made especially for our use on
Mars, but that, like their radios, it could not penetrate the Earth's
atmosphere. The front dial had about a hundred consecutively numbered
lines, with a needle attached to the center. After tuning in, by
pointing the needle at the number I had looked up in a directory lying
there, I could contact and speak to any person I chose. Listed in the
directory were not only the names of my new acquaintances on Mars,
but those of my fellow crew members, my Earth friends as well. In the
center of the dial was a very much smaller dial which gave the exact
time. By tuning in to the weather bureau, I could learn of the weather
conditions twenty-four hours in advance. The message also informed me
that as I increased the number of my acquaintances, I could remove
the present dial and put on one of the few additional dials lying on
the table. After tuning in and dialing the number, by unscrewing the
back cover and placing it to my ear, and talking into the back of the
instrument, I could hear and speak to the person, no matter where
he might be, unless a red light on the instrument indicated that he
was busy talking to someone else. While talking, I could look at the
instrument and see clearly, not only the person, but even all his
facial expressions.</p>

<p>I could keep the instrument in my pocket when I was awake; and if
someone wished to speak to me, the instrument would inflate and deflate
with a throbbing movement, which I could feel immediately.</p>

<p>Upon retiring, I could hang it on a convenient hanger attached to the
headboard over my bed; if someone wished to call me, then it would
awaken me by flashing a bright red light. If I set it at a certain
time, it would ring like an alarm clock.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of this inter-communicating pocket radio-telephone,
or what we here might call a walkie-talkie, I talked for quite a while
with my fellow crew members. I learned that they, like myself, were
having strange and satisfying experiences. They were so enthusiastic,
that they all desired to remain permanently on Mars. As soon as
possible, they wished to go to school to learn the Martian language
and calligraphy. They voiced a strong desire to introduce similar
living conditions on Earth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span> We agreed that we should at the earliest
opportunity consult with Sun-Rank Banard.</p>

<p>After my lengthy conversations with my friends, I sat down on the
chaise longue to meditate upon the significant happenings. Reclining
abstractedly for some time, I then fell asleep.</p>

<p>The bright morning sunlight and the light blinking in the instrument
woke me. Placing it to my ear, I was greeted by the pleasant voice and
face of Sun-Rank Banard.</p>

<p>"Last night when you spoke to your friends, you all expressed a strong
wish to consult me. That wish registered on my mind so definitely that
I could not help at the time from reading your thoughts, which greatly
pleased me. I will communicate with your friends and arrange to have a
plane fly all of you over here to my home today. After dinner we can
take counsel together as to the best means for attaining our objective."</p>

<p>That night after dinner we gathered in Sun-Rank Banard's library, and
addressing our radio operator, he said, "Mr. Galoway, I understand you
are anxious to make some suggestions. I am very much interested in
hearing them."</p>

<p>"Sun-Rank Banard, may I have the privilege to present some of my ideas,
with many of which we Earth men are in accord? If you agree with them,
we would like your advice, and help. Contrary to what Field Marshal
Allenby said, 'We earth dwellers are prisoners on our planet; there
is no way out,' destiny, through you, has given us a way out. Against
our will you took us away from there; we want to assure you now of our
gratitude. We thank you Martians for the privilege granted us to remain
among you. During the short time we have been here, we have found your
living conditions unparalleled. We all intend to take advantage of our
good fortune and become citizens of Mars. We wish to make our lifelong
home here and to form close family unions. If you take us back to
earth, we would not want to remain there; for we do not want to bring
forth our children in the cauldron of the Earth's inferno. However, we
have blood ties there, people who are very dear to us. For the sake of
our relatives and their future generations, and the sake of Earth's
humanity as a whole, we shall devote ourselves to creating, if we can,
a better future world for them. But we need your help.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>"Since we speak fluently, between us here, in ten different languages,
we can be of great help to proselytize from here the people who form
the majority of Earth's population. Or, if you can arrange to let each
one of us separately parachute down to Earth, into the country where
our language is spoken, we can start our work of acquainting them with
your system of life. But, after a reasonable period, after sowing
the seeds, we hope that you will arrange to take us back. That is,
providing we are in good health. If, God forbid, any one of us become
contaminated with an incurable Earth disease, then he should be left on
Earth.</p>

<p>"Since childhood I have always had radio transmitters. I have always
tinkered with them, and made them myself. I have worked at them in all
phases of the industry. I cannot only make them, but also operate them.
I can instruct my fellow Earth men here and also you Martians, if you
will give me the chance in one of your radio factories. Perhaps I can
succeed in making a radio that will penetrate through the atmosphere
of Earth and reach its inhabitants. We then can start a campaign of
broadcasting messages to our fellow men on Earth."</p>

<p>Sun-Rank Banard responded with enthusiasm, "Mr. Galoway, I am most
happy to know your plans and intentions. I shall have you flown
tomorrow to our radio factory and laboratory, where you can conduct
researches with our scientists. You will be provided with all our
materials and facilities. I sincerely hope you prove more successful
than we have been.</p>

<p>"A week from today we can have another conference. I hope by that
time you will have succeeded in your endeavors. Now, gentlemen, it is
getting late. The airplane will fly you all back to your homes. Good
night."</p>

<p>Next morning after breakfast Xora came in and reminded me that she was
ready to take me along to their general stores and show me their method
of distribution. I asked her, "Are you going to do your shopping, while
we are there?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, "We don't shop, buy, or sell on Mars. We are given
supplies; we obtain them. We do not go shopping, as you Earth people
do, merely to look at displays. We go only when we need and are
entitled to obtain an article.</p>

<p>"My tandem plane is all ready," she continued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>We then got into it and took to the air. I sat close to her, my body
alive with the sense of her beauty.</p>

<p>Then she said, "Our chief guide at the administration building of the
ORDDB, our Ordering, Receiving, Distributing and Directory Bureau, has
learned your language, and he is anxiously looking forward to showing
you around."</p>

<p>We were now approaching two beautiful buildings, both wide and high. We
landed near them on a plane parking ground. These two buildings, side
by side, were situated at the southern point of the oval lake, exactly
in the middle of the city's width, running east and west.</p>

<p>Walking to one of the many doors of one of them, I noticed that the
people were all going in one direction only. On the doors were signs
in the Martian language which read <i>For Entrance Only</i>; the exit
doors were on the opposite side of the building. "That is a rule in all
large public buildings in Mars," Xora explained.</p>

<p>In an office on the main floor, Xora introduced me to Mr. Amony, their
head guide, who had been awaiting me. He led us into one of their large
ground floor catalogue rooms, which was similar to the catalogue room
on the third floor of the New York Public Library, but much larger. Two
walls were lined with files in alphabetical order. He showed me how to
use the files, which gave pictures and information concerning all the
articles carried by the stores and instructions on how to obtain them.
These catalogues were the only medium of advertising the stores had.
Newspapers, magazines, mail, radio or airplanes were never used for
advertising purposes.</p>

<p>Each of these buildings, square in shape, covered Earth men's
measurements of eleven hundred by eleven hundred lineal feet. In the
middle court you could place, side by side, two libraries the size
of the New York 42nd Street Public Library Buildings. Each had sixty
catalogue rooms on the ground floor. Each room measured one hundred by
sixty feet. The hallways on the four sides were fifty feet wide and on
every side were escalators, twenty-five feet wide and separated by hand
rails every five feet. The people on Mars used only moving stairways
and no elevators. To reach higher floors quickly, twenty passenger
helicopters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span> were used outside. These constantly operated up and down
to and from every floor landing to ground floor.</p>

<p>There were plane landings on each side on every floor and on the roofs
of buildings higher than five floors. Beside the moving stairways in
these buildings, and in all other large buildings, alongside the moving
stairways were two elevator shafts, one used solely for up traffic, the
other for down. They were each large enough to hold one of our freight
cars, for they measured sixty feet by ten feet.</p>

<p>Used exclusively for freight, these elevators were only platforms
supported by wheels eighteen inches in diameter. They also had gear
wheels on each corner and on the middle of each side. Running up and
down the walls of these shafts were six full-length geared metal beams.
When a platform was in the shaft, the gear wheels closely fitted into
the cogs or gears of the shaft beams and the platform gear wheels
operated either up or down. Weather conditions in re to expansion and
contraction did not loosen or tighten the hold that these gear wheels
had on the beams. Strong springs helped to keep the hold constant.</p>

<p>These platforms were not attached to or supported by cables. They
were not permanent inside fixtures of the shaft; many elevators could
operate at the same time in one shaft, as many as there were floors.
Automatically, they traveled in the shaft at a certain distance from
each other so that they could not collide. When one of them reached its
given floor, the whole line of elevators stopped in the shaft until
this one vacated it. The shaft floor doors opened and released three
rails from the floor into the shaft to support the elevator, while it
released itself from the beams, gears. The elevator then rolled on its
flat wheels onto the rails and then onto the floor. When the rails
snapped back into position, the doors closed, and the other elevators
in the shaft continued on their way to their floors.</p>

<p>Now the released elevator with its load propelled itself to the place
of unloading. On the floor of this elevator were four movable belts.
They were used for loading (pulling on) and unloading (pushing off) a
full load, four units, when all four belts operated, or a half load,
two units, when two belts operated; or a quarter load, one unit, when
one belt operated. One unit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span> was the equivalent of the minimum size of
a load of heavy merchandise that we handle.</p>

<p>When this elevator reached the place of unloading, it hooked onto the
permanent loading platform against the wall, eighteen inches from the
floor. These permanent platforms had metal movable belts for loading
and unloading and when the elevator was hooked to one of them, the
belts on both moved into action. The elevator belts pushed off while
the platform belts pulled on the load. These loading and unloading
belts were on all the freight cars, loading platforms, and on every
deck, on both sides, of our air and sea freight ships.</p>

<p>The same process took place when the elevators were being loaded, but
in reverse; the belts on the permanent platform pushed off and belts
on the elevator pulled on the load at the same time. The elevator
then was on its way to the down-going elevator shaft. When it got up
to the shaft, the doors automatically slid open; all the down-going
elevator platforms stopped; the rails to support the elevator shot into
the shaft, and the elevator propelled itself into the shaft, firmly
gripping with its gear wheels into the cogs of the beams. Then the
floor rails pulled back, the shaft doors closed, and all elevators in
that shaft started down. The destination of these platforms varied;
some of them unloaded onto freight ships, some onto long distance
railroad cars, and some, propelled at great speed, acted as railway
cars on the rails of the city and suburban freight subways, and often
went long distances to their final destinations.</p>

<p>All these operations were done efficiently and by remote control, by a
person sitting at a switch desk, thousands of miles away.</p>

<p>After his long description of how the elevators worked, Mr. Amony led
us to their main waiting room on the ground floor in the middle court,
which, he explained, had an open roof during the summer season and was
protected by skylights during the winters. We sat down and an attendant
quickly served us refreshments. This room was nearly filled with people
waiting to meet their friends. As we ate, Mr. Amony gave us more
information.</p>

<p>"This building is a sample of the hundred stores that run in a row on
our southern water front from east to west for twenty-five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span> miles.
These two buildings, with fifty stories each, have fifty separate
office suites on each floor, totaling two thousand five hundred suites
per building. In this building, fifty store buildings from here west,
are operated and controlled; in our sister building the fifty buildings
from here east are operated."</p>

<p>Leading us to the escalator, he said, "Let us go up and see one of the
offices in action." In the office we visited, there was a personnel of
five; a chief and four assistants. They had complete operating charge
of an entire storage floor in a store building. Each one of them was
responsible for one-quarter space of it. They not only were supposed
to be experts in the special merchandise handled on that floor, but
they also had to do the ordering from the production point and the
inspecting of materials. They had to keep a full supply of stock at all
times.</p>

<p>Seated at their desks with an assortment of business machines,
including a television set, they could clearly see the floor under
their control. From their seats, they operated heavily loaded elevator
platforms to the appointed portions of their floor. Loading and
unloading, taking up and storing, and taking out units of merchandise
to near or distant destinations were done by them.</p>

<p>One operation attracted my particular attention. A large freight ship
was being unloaded under a store building. I could very clearly see
it on the television. The ship had just anchored directly beneath the
elevator shafts, following the orders of the clerk by whom we were
standing. A removable metal frame was being put together by the ship's
crew to fit into the up-going shaft, through the hatch, and right down
to the bottom of the hold.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the clerk was manipulating an empty elevator platform in
the down-going shaft to the ship's deck. When the frame had been
securely placed in the up-going shaft, he guided the elevator into
it and down to the bottom of the ship. Then, propelling it out, from
this frame to a large loader of four units on the platform within the
ship, he skillfully loaded it on the elevator. The loaded elevator he
now moved back into the temporary frame, up the elevator shaft, and
on to its floor. He neatly unloaded it at its appointed place. All
that maneuvering was accomplished quickly without hitch or man power
by buttons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span> and two-inch levers on the desk. The clerk certainly had
complete control of his elevator platforms.</p>

<p>I could not help calling out, "Bravo! Bravo!"</p>

<p>At the adjoining desk another clerk was loading an underground subway
freight car and speeding it to its distant destination.</p>

<p>Addressing myself to Mr. Amony, I asked, "These clerks seem to have
great responsibility. Do they have the authority to give their orders
to the producers or factories supplying the merchandise under their
control?"</p>

<p>"Of course," he answered. "Not only that, but the manager at the
factory has that floor where his goods are kept constantly under his
vision; therefore, he knows when the floor is under or overstocked.
After daily consultation, he and the clerks here on duty manage to keep
the supply sufficient. Samples of the merchandise in these units are
always mailed to this office for inspection before the merchandise is
shipped. We have only one factory for every individual article, with
its branches on all our continents. They work together and compete with
each other to produce the best of a single material thing or article
allotted them. Executives for our industries are appointed solely for
their experience, and efficiency, and not through political or other
influences. It is the same in personnel.</p>

<p>"This system of remote control, with few exceptions, is used by us on
vehicles, locomotives, passenger airplanes, and machines doing heavy
duty work, such as those you would call bulldozers, plows, or other
farm machinery. In fact, we use it for almost all laborious work
and engineering projects, on stationary and mobile engines, and on
machinery used on dry land, marshes, and on the fertile floors of the
sea."</p>

<p>Addressing Xora, he said, "Let us give our visitor a look into one of
our mechanical factories across the river. I will meet you outside
factory No. 100 in half an hour."</p>

<p>We landed in a large open parking ground where Mr. Amony was waiting
for us. As he guided us into a large building, he said, "I am surprised
you Earth men don't go in for similar manufacturing and improvements
and reforms. They have the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span> idea, which we hope will soon be also in
operation. Look!" Meeting our sight was a</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Factory as clean, spacious, and continuously operating as
hydro-electric plant. The production floor is barren of men. Only a
few engineers, technicians, and operators walk about on a balcony
above, before a great wall of master control panels, inserting
and checking records, watching and adjusting batteries of control
instruments. All else is automatic. Raw materials flow in by conveyor,
move through automatic inspection units, fabricating machines,
sub-assembly and assembly lines, all controlled from the master
panels, and arrive at the automatic packaging machines a finished
product."<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>"We have machines that see better than eyes, calculate more reliably
than brains, communicate faster and farther than the voice, record
more accurately than memory, and act faster and better than hands.
These devices are not subject to any human limitations. They do not
mind working around the clock. They never feel hunger or fatigue. They
are always satisfied with working conditions."<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Now Xora interrupted, "I need a garment which is in the store building
of No. 1 east. Let us go there."</p>

<p>I found this store impressive. Mr. Amony explained that the other
ninety-nine stores were of similar size, but carried different
articles. They received, stored, delivered, and distributed all
foods and merchandise and other necessities and luxuries for all the
inhabitants of Amboria.</p>

<p>These buildings were sixty stories high. The first ten stories in each
of these hundred buildings were used for shopping, display, individual
ordering, and disposing of merchandise to shoppers. Each floor had its
own exclusive kind of merchandise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>Going up the moving stairway to the first floor, we landed in front of
a slowly moving, large, circular inside platform twenty-five feet wide,
which went on the floor around the full size of the building. On both
sides of this platform were plush rope rails with many openings and
provided with comfortable seats. An attendant at each opening helped
people off and on.</p>

<p>Alongside this moving platform was a stationary floor of twenty-five
feet in width for walkers. We sat on a seat for three on the moving
platform, and were taken around to see the beautiful displays on
dummies and on beautiful living models. Each side of the floor showed
its own special variety of displays. My feeling was that the ladies
on Mars were no different from ours insofar as feminine finery was
concerned.</p>

<p>From the moving platform to the show cases was a ten foot stationary
floor, where the distributors and recipients were sitting on
comfortable seats and were being shown different articles and
negotiating transfers. As we were nearing a special display, Xora left
us sitting, and lightly stepped off the platform. During her absence,
Mr. Amony gave me some information.</p>

<p>"The attendants in our merchandising department are called merchandise
distributors, not salespeople. We have no high pressure employees.
Our distributive system is more simple than yours, which I have seen
through television. We do not advertise. We have no bargain sales or
substituting. Our attendants are courteous. The people they serve give
them courtesy in return.</p>

<p>"We try not to strain the patience of our distributors. We provide
comfortable seats for them. Your salespeople spend hours on their feet.
The high pressure selling methods induce nervous tension and fatigue.
They become old before their time.</p>

<p>"After the day's work is over, our distributors are not worried whether
they have sold the day's quota or have made a commission. They are not
afraid of losing their jobs or having their salaries reduced, because
of a shortage in merchandise. We have no shoplifters or detectives in
our stores."</p>

<p>By this time Xora had returned from her shopping. We thanked Mr. Amony
for his kind services and departed. As we approached the plane parking
ground, I suggested that we fly to the center lake, as I wanted very
much to hear the symphony orchestra<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span> which was playing about this time.
At the same time, I took her hand and held it firmly but very tenderly.
She blushed deeply, but her return pressure gave me my answer.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she said, "We can spend some time there and have our
afternoon tea." Hand in hand, we again took to the air. Soon we landed
in a secluded portion of the center parkway, near the center lake.</p>

<p>We were served tea with a large assortment of dainty little sandwiches,
cakes, fruits, and candies. The sweet soft music permeating the air
exalted me, and we were both wrapped in the exultation of our newly
found love.</p>

<p>My deep love for her made me more happy than I had ever been in my
life. I could hardly express what I wanted to say. But she seemed to
understand. She listened attentively, and when I started stammering,
she pressed my hand to encourage me. I was astonished that such a
wonderful girl could have any interest in a blundering person like me.
When I had finished, she answered, "I love you, too; I loved you the
first time I saw you on Mars.</p>

<p>"You must know that I watched you in our television when grandfather
took possession of your plane," she continued, "and I greatly admired
your actions and the way you carried yourself. It wasn't hard to grow
to love you.</p>

<p>"You must understand that we have no sympathy with many of the
conditions on earth. I was deeply impressed when Grandfather told me
about the conference he had with you and your Earth friends, and of the
plan you boys have made. The news has been broadcast all over Mars.
Your success or even a partial one will be an outstanding feat of our
time.</p>

<p>"We all hope that our sincere admiration for you boys shall be an
inspiration for your success. We shall encourage you and take great
pride in your work. Even though you don't succeed fully, but only plant
among your people the seed of the way we live our life, I will be just
as proud of your achievement."</p>

<p>We spent the whole afternoon, until late in the evening, telling each
other of our love, and planning and hoping for our future.</p>

<p>We were in a deep embrace when her mother called her on the
inter-communicating instrument to come home.</p>

<p>That was the most momentous day of my life.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A week after</span> our first meeting, we again met in Sun-Rank Banard's
library. Addressing Mr. Galoway, he said, "I am very sorry to hear
that you have failed to find the missing element for the proposed
radio transmitter. You certainly tried hard enough. But don't let this
discourage us. In a conference with several of our Supreme Council
members, we decided that it might be a good plan to take Lieutenant
Balmore back to Earth and let him parachute down right over his home.
He can disseminate the experiences he has had on our planet and, at
the same time, acquire an airplane with the best high frequency radio
transmitter. Then he can contact us on our airship at a prearranged
time and place.</p>

<p>"Before he leaves, it may be a good idea to take down in shorthand
notes and memorize a convincing lecture with illustrations which may
succeed in influencing and possibly converting terrestrial men to our
way. I am now going to show you television and moving pictures of some
of the gruesome happenings on Earth. I may find it necessary to offend
many of your people on Earth by exposing their grim way of living and
I will even have to exhort them; but I feel that my method may be the
best way to arouse serious attention. You will have to steel yourselves
against not only what I am going to tell you but what you will see
with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span> your own eyes of the horrible ordeal on Earth in both past and at
present. These pictures were shown only to a few Martians. I certainly
would like to show them to your Earth peoples, or at least to your
ruling class. Your economic system is so strongly entrenched that I
doubt your living generations can or will even try to take advantage
of my findings or counsel. I will have made a start if the coming ones
will benefit. Our combined talks, and suggestions will be recorded and
translated into each of your different languages. When the occasion
arises, you may reach your people in your own language.</p>

<p>"It will be important for each one of you to be able to give the
history of your adventures, the details of your landing experience.
Vividly contrast our way of living on Mars with the way of living on
Earth; then you may in your own way tell them of the lecture I shall
give you now.</p>

<p>"We have found that human beings here and on your Earth have
potentially the same physical and mental caliber. Nature implanted in
all of us the primitive instincts of selfishness, acquisitiveness,
and brutality. By some good fortune our primordial ancestors on Mars
started to cast off and definitely curb these instincts and aversions
by good judgment, reason and repression, and have forcibly continued to
do so until evolution has eliminated our undesirable traits.</p>

<p>"Our early progenitors ingrafted in us high ideals, thus developing in
us a high mentality; fortunately we have not inherited your instinct
to desire wealth and power for individual self. We, like yourselves,
require good health, love, happiness, good nourishment, warm and
fashionable clothing, sanitary, and comfortable homes, safety against
want and old age, dependence, medical care, luxuries, and honors.</p>

<p>"On our globe we have intensified the production of natural resources
from our lands, seas, and air until now we can produce more than we
actually need. Every Martian gets his necessities free as a matter of
right and his expensive luxuries and honors according to the merit of
his achievements.</p>

<p>"Your forefathers, even though they were groping for the best way
of life, through ignorance, gradually drifted into the path of
least resistance. From time immemorial you have always desired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span> the
acquisition of more wealth than you needed, to give you power over your
fellow man.</p>

<p>"We on Mars have been objective observers of your sick economic system.
We have carefully studied its functions. Although I do not pretend to
be an expert, I have consulted with our own experts, and feel myself
qualified to make suggestions. From the analysis we have made, we
call it moneyism which is the root of your economic evils. Your whole
existence centers around your desire for money, and you are handicapped
in that you must have money to live even a comparatively normal
existence.</p>

<p>"In nature, only living matter is productive. But contrary to natural
law, you have created money, interest and reproductivity into an
unnatural body, that has elements of the corrupt.</p>

<p>"I am not going into the detailed dogmas of your economists, nor will I
define them and their functions; but I will try to give you a summary
of the history of money, past and present.</p>

<p>"Money started in your ancient times, as a barter system.</p>

<p>"Beginning by gradual evolution in your stone age, you started with
living money like cattle, slaves, next came shells, colored fancy
stones, stone axes, and tools. Then your earth man discovered iron ore,
mining and smelting. At that time iron was scarce and became the most
valuable metal of the time. You forged it into lance points, arrow
points; then into axes, knives, swords, arm and leg bracelets, using
these articles as a medium of exchange.</p>

<p>"You afterward discovered silver, gold, other metals, and precious
stones. With your innate craving for self decoration, you forged golden
crowns, medals, belts, arm and leg bracelets for your leaders or kings;
and then earrings, necklace, finger, and nose rings, and arm and ankle
bracelets for your sweethearts, wives, and daughters. Thus, the more
scarce and rare the metals, the more valuable they became, starting the
medium of barter and exchange in metal bullion and coins.</p>

<p>"You find an account in your Bible.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'In Genesis XX, 15, "And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before
thee; dwell where it pleaseth thee." 16, And unto Sarah he said,
"Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver; behold
it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span> is for thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee, and
to all others. Thus she was reproved."'</p>
</div>

<p>"The American Indians and white settlers used wampum as money. Tobacco
government warehouse deposit certificates were also used as money.</p>

<p>"In some of your Southern Pacific Islands your cannibal tribes used
compressed human heads and skulls to purchase their wives; in Africa
ivory elephant tusks were used and others of you have used a great many
other mediums of exchange.</p>

<p>"Mr. Norman Angell, one of your economists, in his book, <i>The Story
of Money</i>, gives a clear description of the uses of money. He says
it is used</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"As a medium of exchange, a measure of value, a standard of deferred
payment, and as a store of value."<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>
</div>

<p>"Mr. Victor L. Clark, one of your authors, in his book <i>What is
Money</i>, says that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is something with which we can buy goods and services."<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>
</div>

<p>He further writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In the 16th century, 'a new aspect of credit appeared.'<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>"deposit banking developed out of an ancient custom of leaving money
in safe keeping with responsible merchants."<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>
</div>

<p>"In the 16th century banking by check system was started in Amsterdam
by large Dutch Banking Companies, bringing into existence your present
system of moneyism. Later, London goldsmiths began to create bank money
by issuing receipts or other paper instruments originating out of money
in bullion of copper, silver and gold by weight deposited with them, or
loaned out by them, on which they paid out or received interest.</p>

<p>"This practice of saving and getting interest on money started your
moneyism system, gradually developing into your present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span> stupendous one
which holds in its power every one of you on Earth.</p>

<p>"Where the profit angle is concerned, you seem to forget and not to
adhere to traditional and religious custom and laws.</p>

<p>"It may be unknown by many of you, that the receiving or charging
of interest, was, and still is condemned in most of your religious
scriptures, as immoral, illegal, and sinful.</p>

<p>"During your Roman era, and even for some time afterwards among your
world nations interest charging was severely punished as a crime.</p>

<p>"Interest charging, contrary to your religious precepts, is now not
only legal, but justified, and is the fundamental principle of your
moneyism.</p>

<p>"Every one of your nations and states legally permits a different
standard level of interest plus premiums, commissions, and other
charges. In some of them it has reached high usury proportions.</p>

<p>"Land and commercial moneyism, in existence for so long, brought on
your money and industrial financiering. Inasmuch as you gentlemen come
from the United States of America, the foremost financial country of
your world, we had better concentrate on it.</p>

<p>"Don't let us confuse your money system with your form of government,
or political economy with your political science. They are two
different, and distinct entities.</p>

<p>"Your founding fathers certainly originated a sound form of government.
You can be proud of your constitution, your three branches of
government, your bill of rights. We on Mars feel it is the best
government on your earth, outside of your economic system, in many
ways similar to ours. As your traditional and very ancient custom
for the benefit and protection of your citizens and for the purpose
of withholding its control from greedy, monopolistic or dishonest
individuals, as well as guarantee its uniform value, your government
was compelled then, as it is duty bound now, to assume the many
responsible and most important money functions, as well as create,
promulgate, and enforce its laws, developing the following bureaus and
departments. The bureaus of the mint, engraving, the office of the
treasurer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span> register of the treasury, controller of currency, the farm
loan bureau and the federal reserve system.</p>

<p>"Thus Congress, the Treasury, and the Federal Reserve, are the
fountain heads of your money and moneyism; your banks, its multiplex
reproduction incubators, and foster parents reproducing it with
lightning rapidity, through interest, compound interest, dividends,
bonuses, premiums, commissions, dues, rents, and profits. Your
commercial and investment banks and your trust companies receive,
pay out, finance foreign credits, underwrite and distribute new
securities, and buy government and state bonds. There are more than
14,855 establishments, with arteries in more than 20,000 large business
savings and investments. National and state banks and trust companies
are located in all your large and small cities. Many of them are
members of the Federal Reserve Banks. Your 300 large life insurance
companies and all other lesser ones, your great number of private
bankers, your financial investment, loan, and mortgage companies,
your pawn and stock brokers, and your many other financiers control
the loans of money. They loan it on stocks, bonds, notes, commercial
paper, collateral securities, on contracts of future deliveries of
all staple commodities, imports, exports, real estate mortgages; to
nearly all of your industrial, commercial houses and utility companies,
transportation, shipping, your farms, your business, your home, your
furniture, your food, your automobiles, trucks, your jewelry, your
clothes, your tools, your wages, and anything you possess of value.
Even on your false teeth. That money loaned to you is derived from your
savings, dues, and premiums.</p>

<p>"Bonus and other charges and loans to you are as high as the companies
can get. Some of them ask the highest usurious rates allowed by your
different legal state rates, and other charges are added—as much as
they can milk out of you. Note that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The civic agencies conducting the Dallas, Texas loan shark fight
found that interest as high as 1,131.4%, over 3% per day, was charged
gullible victims. The lowest interest rate was 120% per annum, and the
average 271.68%."<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>"Money circulation and interest are the most expensive operations in
your moneyism. Mr. Norman Angell in his book <i>Story of Money</i>
calls it 'Velocity Circulation.'<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Money travels rapidly from hand to
hand, from one pocketbook to another, from bank to bank, to borrower or
drawer, in constant circulation.</p>

<p>"Has any one of your economists calculated how many times an active
one-dollar multiplies itself in a year from the time it is first
issued from the Treasury? How much does it earn in interest, compound
interest, commissions, bonuses, dividends, and profit gain from
constantly being shifted from person to person, bank to bank, and loan
to loan? Or how many times does the actively circulated dollar change
hands per day, month, or year? Your World Almanac, 1950, page 716,
gives the deposits for the year 1949 as one hundred and fifty-five
billion dollars, and on page 715, money in circulation for 1948 of
$28,224,000,000. Every one of these dollars must have earned quite a
lot in interest and must have multiplied itself many times on its rapid
velocity circulation.</p>

<p>"How about your floating currency, in safe deposit vaults, pocketbooks,
pockets, or hidden away underneath mattresses and in hundreds of
nooks? How much of it is in the hands of foreign holders all over the
world? And in their banks going through the same interest-earning and
loaning-out processes?</p>

<p>"For your convenience in receiving, withdrawing, and checking out your
money and for other services that your bank performs for you, you are
being charged in many ways. The banks do not allow your money to lie
idle. It must work and earn interest and other charges over and over.</p>

<p>"Other powers in your moneyism are your Stock Exchanges and Boards
of Trade. Security trading has developed and perfected these Stock
Exchanges to the point where they are the main financial markets in
your United States as well as in all other financial centers of your
world. They are the mediums to help keep securities at all times in a
liquid and convertible state; they are the main avenues where buyers
and sellers can always transact a purchase, or sale of stocks and
bonds. The Boards of Trade are the mediums or markets for transacting
purchases and sales of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span> your staple commodities like wheat, corn,
cotton, eggs, butter, coffee, and other staples.</p>

<p>"The New York Stock Exchange with its 1,375 broker members and members
of your other exchanges and Boards of Trade in New York and other
cities are the agencies of purchases and sales from client to client
for cash or on margin for your stocks, bonds, and future staple
agricultural commodities. These brokers also do a sort of banking
business with their money and profits, and with money they borrow on
call from banks at 1% and 2% interest and charge their customers 6%.
They trade not only for their clients, but also among themselves.</p>

<p>"The next power in your moneyism is rent: Payment for the use and
occupancy of property owned by another party as landlord. It is another
form of interest on invested money. Rent is nothing else but a gain or
interest on money. The rents paid for your homes, apartments, shops,
offices, business houses, farms, and equipment, must be an enormous
expense for you.</p>

<p>"Profit, another form of interest, is an expensive process of your
money system. The Romans had a saying, <i>Caveat Emptor</i>, 'Let the
buyer beware.' History shows that your industrial, and commercial
business, and services have always been based on hard bargaining. The
desire for more money gain was and is so deeply impregnated in you
that it has blunted and broken down your ethical standards. You have
always tried to get the most gain for the least value. Some sellers
take advantage by overcharging, underweighing, substitutions. Others,
through their open and secret control of combinations, and cartels
create price fixing pools. Some manufacturers, retailers, contractors,
and producers monopolize and create a scarcity and a demand. The
consumer through necessity is compelled to purchase from them, or from
cut-throat grey and black markets.</p>

<p>"Your World Almanac of 1950, page 652, gives for 1945 as many as
250,881 manufacturing establishments, with wholesale value of
manufacturing at $74,425,825,000 on page 656 for 1948, and retail sales
at $130,000,000,000. Whatever you purchase has also an added cost by
billions of dollars for advertising, from your biggest article down to
your match or piece of chewing gum.</p>

<p>"Your credit sales and charge accounts have not only increased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
the cost of your purchases, but have intensified the demand for
luxuries you do not need or can't afford. You buy these things on the
installment plan, even if you have to pay more, plus interest, to carry
your account.</p>

<p>"Commissions, and fee payments on your purchases, sales, and rental
collections to stock, bond, real estate, and commodity brokers plus
your attorneys' fees is another enormous and excessive drain on your
resources.</p>

<p>"The economic financial incubuses you have created now control your
lives, from the day of your conception, until long after your death.
With your money they directly control your most essential industries;
and indirectly hold ownership through their loans, and mortgages, of
your business, your homes, farms, stock, lands. They are on the Board
of Directors, guiding the policy and controlling all your financial
institutions and your most profitable enterprises taking most of the
profit for themselves by devious methods. To hide and not openly
show their large earnings, they often by subterfuge, declare and cut
'melons' to their stockholders by exchanging three, four or more shares
of the same company for every one of their shares. By this artifice,
they endeavor to show a smaller dividend as well as make the new issue
of shares of a lower value, for manipulative and trading purposes. They
also continuously increase their capitalizations or lower their par
value sometimes for the same purpose.</p>

<p>"They even control your new discoveries, and inventions, which they
get possession of, for mere pittances. They often suppress some of
them to suit their convenience. Through their financial power they
directly and indirectly control and influence the political status
of your land. They control operations of agriculture, commerce,
industry, transportation, utilities, shipping and all kinds of
intercommunication, your wineries, breweries, distilleries, and
your tobacco industries, from the smallest business to your largest
enterprise. Ultimately restricting your opportunities for economic
advancement.</p>

<p>"All these are interrelated: your Banks, Trust Companies, Business
Banks, Savings Banks, Financial Companies, Loan Companies, Life and
other Insurance Companies, Stock Companies and Exchanges, Boards of
Trade, and other exchanges. Stock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span> brokers, real estate brokers, pawn
brokers, with numerous branches covering the best locations in the
United States, occupy many buildings and establishments, and send their
private wires over every section of your nation and foreign countries.
All of them are maintained at your expense through your large deposit
reservoir and your earnings.</p>

<p>"Your moneyism has weakened you mentally, physically, and morally and
has created in you an unquenchable desire for their acquisition; from
your poorest to purchase his bare necessities to your richest to get
richer, bringing on deficit spending, mounting debts, increasing taxes,
incessant relief and unemployment payments. All these with no end in
sight.</p>

<p>"Everywhere, everyone among you always has a demand, and you create the
demand for more and more money. You always have need for more of it,
for more financing, and there never seems to be enough of it. But it is
only your few who seem to get it and hold it."</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><i>Octopus Colossus</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sun-Rank Banard </span>remarked, "It's time for lunch, so let's adjourn to
the thought transmission-proof dining room. Our women folk are away
visiting, so we will be by ourselves, and we can informally and freely
converse."</p>

<p>During the meal we carried on an animated and pleasant conversation in
which Sun-Rank Banard very often joined. The gist of it was mainly, at
our earth men's lack of impression and perception of earth conditions.</p>

<p>Our boys were astonished at the detailed information the Martians had
on our earth life. One said that he had never clearly thought through
its economic ills. He had merely accepted them. Although he had heard
and studied many of these points, they are beginning to now take on a
new significance. Another remarked that the observers seem to be more
impressed and are more retentive to what takes place, than those who
are within the actual performance of the scenes of our life's functions.</p>

<p>Sun-Rank Banard said, "Now let's go back and continue the lecture.</p>

<p>"Nature on your earth has destined and caused man to come into
existence, and has provided him with parents to protect him during his
helpless infancy and childhood. During his growth, development, and
maturity, it endowed him with a mentality higher than that of other
animals. But in spite of his intelligence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span> he is often more cruel than
predatory jungle beasts, especially to his fellow men.</p>

<p>"Creation is prolific even prodigal in its overabundance of production
for your necessities and can produce and supply the needs of a
population more than twice your number, providing you all will work;
but many of you, for a life of ease, use this God-given intelligence
especially for acquisition, storing and hoarding as a means of power
over your fellow man.</p>

<p>"During the Stone Age, your each tribe lived together in caves
adjoining each other for protection, primitively tilling the soil, and
grazing your cattle around your habitations.</p>

<p>"It was then the survival of brute force. The bully domineered and
became the leader of his tribe, acquiring for himself the most wives
and food and the best shelter. The next best he bestowed upon his gang.</p>

<p>"For defensive and offensive weapons against predatory animals and
tribes, you used stones and stone axes. Brute force gradually lost
its power when the more progressive one of the tribe became adept and
dexterous with his stone throwing sling, his lance, and his bows and
arrows. He then succeeded to the leadership.</p>

<p>"As your numbers increased, you expanded your land holdings. This
continued from generation to generation; from squatters you graduated
according to your own laws of possession until the time came when you
were encroaching on the lands of your neighboring tribes, starting
your process of forceful aggression and acquisition. With the Iron Age
started the evolution of your civilization, with sharp iron-pointed
lances, arrows, and axes, leading to the barbarous Middle Ages.</p>

<p>"Laws of property ownership, and barter of land, slaves, cattle, furs,
clothes, utensils, ornaments, food, and offensive and defensive weapons
marked the beginning of this era. In its constant evolution, property
ownership law was continually and mercilessly improved according to
your standards, with the utter enslavement of weaker tribes, and races
who were a good source for procuring slaves and extracting tribute.</p>

<p>"In the further property development during succeeding centuries your
ancestors continually improved, and increased their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span> property power
so that now it is the dominant factor controlling the very life and
destiny of every one of you.</p>

<p>"You have defined and legalized property as everything on your
earth capable and possible of being possessed, and owned, including
intangibles. It even includes the waters of your rivers, your seas, and
the atmosphere over your earth surface, and you seem to be disputing
the ownership of the clouds. Sunshine and air, for the time being, are
still free and cannot be owned and claimed.</p>

<p>"Your Webster's Dictionary defines property as a thing owned, exclusive
right of possession.</p>

<p>"Your Amendments to your United States Constitution, Article V, also
gives assent to property. They say, 'Nor shall private property be
taken for public use without just compensation.'</p>

<p>"You have created it into and described it as wealth, or money. You
have advanced it from stage to stage and perfected and increased
its power to make it a fluid currency system without which no one
can obtain or purchase the necessities of life. You have outlawed
compulsory slavery, for a better system which <i>compels you to
voluntarily hire yourself out</i>.</p>

<p>"Those in power, to protect themselves, helped to pass strong laws
for property control. Not content with the ownership of basic raw
materials, real estate, financial affairs, transportation, utilities,
and food production and distribution, they systematically entered
into every sphere of industrial manufacturing—commercial fields,
transportation, shipping, in fact every necessity of your life's
existence—through individual ownership, partnership, companies,
corporations, holding companies, national and international cartels,
and chain company stores.</p>

<p>"To supply the labor they need in their enterprises, most of you,
through necessity, hire yourselves out to them either individually or
through union contracts.</p>

<p>"Their accumulative hoarding, cartel, and pool forming to control,
monopolize, and corner industry are such that you are forced to
purchase your necessities from them only, at the highest profit. Thus
you pay for products, which, without your labor, could not have been
created into value. Your ownership and lack of ownership of property,
wealth, and power are the main contributive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span> causes for 98% of the laws
you make and have on your statute books.</p>

<p>"Your controlling class who largely contribute to political campaigns
influence your ruling class through political parties who openly
or secretly help to elect some of their representatives to your
Congress, or appoint former directors, and attorneys as members of
important key cabinet and diplomatic offices. Their numerous inside
and outside lobbyists and subservient newspapers influence the passing
and suppression of laws. They even volunteer as advisers to your
administrations. Most of your professional politicians 'kowtow' and are
servile to them.</p>

<p>"There is always great agitation going on in regard to labor. Next
to war, it is the most important problem to your government and most
exciting discussions and newspaper headliners.</p>

<p>"Your moneyism and labor struggles are an old, festering sore. These
struggles are the general cause of your poverty and destitution. Your
system is such that you have no cure in sight. No matter how successful
you may be in your unionized demands for more remuneration, prices
and values are bound to spiral upward, increasing your living cost in
proportion. You are infallibly moving in a vicious circle which tends
for the rich to get richer. Many among you are born with pronounced
natural aptitudes; some of you have strongly developed these aptitudes
and inclinations and constantly use your full mentality and energy
for accumulation and hoarding for your own use. But you also use this
proficiency especially to gain power through the need of others. The
school boy with the accumulative instinct will spend most of his time
training himself to become an expert marble shooter in order to win
those of his schoolmates. Even though they should find his full bag of
marbles and divide them amongst themselves, or should he voluntarily
give them the marbles, there is no question that he is bound to always
win them back again.</p>

<p>"It is the same with your money and wealth; their division among all
of you would not heal your economic diseases, because it would be only
a question of a short time before most of you would lose yours to the
shrewd and crafty ones among you; very possibly to the same ones who
held them before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>"Money, which you developed as the medium of exchange to facilitate
accumulation, store of value, and property transfer, grew into the
agency of tribute or usury power, progressively expanding to an extent
comparable to that of an enormous, monster Octopus Colossus, covering
and holding your entire earth within its grasp. Each of his tentacles
is a symbol representing your economic and other ills. Each one of
them multiplies into clusters or parasites. They are submissive and
especially amenable in the hands of those of you who are adept, and
know how to manipulate them. With the connivance and at the direction
of these operators, they hold humanity in bondage. Continually
searching, they reach every corner, nook, and cranny within the
innermost recesses of your homes. You have no hiding place or escape
from them. They produce and contribute to all your ills and control
every act of your life.</p>

<p>"'On the one side, man is so heroic and so noble, and on the other side
so base and so cruel,' Mark Twain once said. Time again many of your
economists have tried to extricate you; they have wrestled with these
tentacles and, like the old tribal medicine men, recommended cutting
each one off, but like the nine heads of Hydra, each one of these
tentacles on being cut off becomes two. These economists, by their
other nostrums, try to convince you they have found a cure; each one of
them has his own theory. Your libraries are full of their books.</p>

<p>"Time and again many of you have tried to find a way to save
yourselves, but have been betrayed by your corrupt leaders, who,
through selfish motives, have led you deeper into the quagmire of the
dangerous morass they create for you. They and theirs may some day also
become the victims.</p>

<p>"One of these tentacles spreads and disseminates the infectious polio
and other deadly diseases by distributing from person to person your
disease-carrying, paper money and metal coins. It takes them out from
the foulest and dirtiest parts and places of some of the unbathed,
drunken, and diseased bodies of your living and dead persons. This
money passes along from person to person and merchant to merchant,
handled constantly by your food handlers, held by your children in
their hands and even in their mouths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>"Another tentacle taints you with pride, arrogance, contempt,
insatiable greed, covetousness, and lust. It brings in its wake envy,
jealousy, hatred, and malice, followed by the most atrocious crimes. It
breeds temptation, suspicion, dishonesty, ingratitude, and corruption,
vitiates your entire morale. It was directly and indirectly the cause
of 1,361,593 known crimes in the United States, ranging from murder
to petty larceny for the year 1943. It is responsible for physical,
mental, and organic disorders of diseases among 95% of your population.
It is the cause of separations, divorces, and even of serious
misunderstandings between parents and children, brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>"Still another one of them coiling about you incites and forms in you
a strong magnetic desire to pursue wealth, even by the most unfair or
illegal means and methods, destroying in you your finer human feelings.
It brings out in you the primitive instinct to plot the undoing of
your fellow man to gain his property. It not only distorts your good
resolutions, but in many of your individuals and nations, it creates
greed to the point that a promise, a contract, or a treaty, no matter
how inviolable, is with impunity cancelled or broken.</p>

<p>"How many of you can conscientiously plead innocent to your own selves
that you at no time illegally or immorally benefited from your fellow
man? Many of you boast how smart you are in cheating your friend.</p>

<p>"Desire for money has blunted your moral views to the point that many
of you do not know or do not want to know what a moral sin may be. It
has created among you many flatterers, and hypocrites. Many of you join
ultra-exclusive clubs, orders, lodges, and other similar organizations
solely for this purpose. Some of you even choose your religions with
these motives.</p>

<p>"For money, you even subdue your natural love instinct. The craving for
money makes many of you desire, and some of you execute the death of
your nearest and dearest relatives or friends, in order to enable you
to inherit his property or to cash in on his life insurance policy.</p>

<p>"Those of you who have developed in yourselves the habit of thriftiness
are very gullible. You deposit your savings in banks, for interest
earnings and safety. A great many of you have lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span> your life's savings
through dishonest mismanagement of these banks, or other mediums of
savings.</p>

<p>"You who are called the general public; farmer, professional man,
small businessman, white collar worker, laborer, widow, orphan, old
person; those who pinched penny by penny to accumulate a little nest
egg, those who mortgaged your homes, those who saved it at extreme
sacrifices, denying yourselves certain luxuries or necessities, to
the point of avarice—you have listened to the evil persuasion of
high pressure. You have read the enticing overstatements in your
newspapers, financial papers, and company reports, you have listened
to professional tipsters, financial wizards, or your bank's financial
expert and adviser offering you a lifetime opportunity to purchase
investments supposed to pay good interest and dividends. Or you have
diligently read your stockbrokers' pamphlets and daily sheets. You
have watched stock and bond fluctuations on ticker or boards in their
sumptuous board rooms. You have been enticed into high finance, stock
exchanges, boards of trade, and commodities—all of them types of
gambling producing revenue. It is a wonderful system to fleece you
of your savings. Your big financiers with their executives, whom you
helped to elect with your proxies, have a permanent stranglehold on
all your basic industries. They always aim to have you 'the public,'
invest your money into their companies and corporations, in fact,
become majority holders of their securities. It's with your money
that they finance them. They are satisfied to be the insiders with
control and management holding a minority of stock. Presumptuously,
these executives not only pay themselves from $50,000 to $600,000 and
over, yearly salaries, but some of them also have the impudence to get
themselves voted large yearly lifetime retirement pensions. They are
past masters in creating and influencing a demand for their stock among
you, declaring and increasing interests and dividends, manipulating
the stock markets to create an artificial boom, and spreading news of
a bull market. They load you with the supposed gilt-edged investments
at high prices from their portfolios, that they are gradually emptying.
After they have sold their securities to you and have entirely emptied
their strongboxes of them, these philanthropists sell you more on
'short' sales of shares<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span> they don't possess. Thus they make you the
'holder of the bag.'</p>

<p>"Then they start their bearish news and decrease and even pass interest
and dividends, bringing on a depression, forcing you to sell at a
sacrifice. They wipe out your margin and your collateral bank loans;
then they gradually purchase the shares back again at bargain prices.</p>

<p>"They are very discriminating. They do not purchase back securities of
those enterprises which by their mismanagement they wrecked. They are
sure of getting control of them again for a song during reorganization.
Thus, you are left with many valueless stock and bond certificates and
with a complete loss of your savings. Every ten or fifteen years they
use the same scheme to plunder and to again entrap you, adding new
dupes each time. Your stock market collapse of 1929 was not a natural
phenomenon, but a man-made concerted crime. With their old tactics of
surreptitiously bidding for stocks, they created a boom and a demand
for the securities, until every one of you got the stock-buying fever
and craze. No one of you was immune—the street sweeper, dishwasher,
bellboy, all were becoming rich, pyramiding your stock holdings, and
your paper profits were increasing from day to day. Then the time came
when the financiers generously unloaded the last of their securities on
you, as well as sold you more on short sales. They then stopped bidding
for stocks, taking out the props from under the market and letting it
decline through its own momentum.</p>

<p>"The market was like a large overflowing lake with a weak dam. It burst
and created a flood overwhelming your whole house of cards in your
financial world. It was followed by the most drastic panicky drive
against all commodities and industrial production prices. The crash
brought on ruin by closing weak banks, building and loan companies,
and financial houses. It wiped out the savings of millions of people
through bankruptcies and foreclosures of an unprecedented panic. The
result was a large world wide depression which lasted for years.</p>

<p>"And when you, the public, had finished throwing over securities at the
bottom of market prices, who purchased them? Why, those who originally
sold them to you.</p>

<p>"Not content to rig the stock markets, they also trade and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span> corner
in futures of your most staple commodities. Again, the 'public' is
inveigled, and again you are made the losers, not only in the gambling
losses but also in the increase of your costs of bread, meats, sugar,
coffee, and other necessities.</p>

<p>"These people are more treacherous to each other than wolves. They
would just as soon ruin their own set as not. Their financial
activities according to your laws are not only legal, but very
respectable.</p>

<p>"They are among the most respected of your world. They belong and are
the leaders of not only your most exclusive clubs, and societies, but
are the top members of your so-called high class social world, and live
in the utmost luxury and affluence.</p>

<p>"The Octopus has other mediums in which his tentacles excel. To exploit
from you enormous profits, he craftily and mercilessly by seductive
propaganda, and intensive methods of advertising, subverted and
succeeded in turning 90% of your Earth population toward habits of
indulgence, greatly contributing to your extensive organic diseases,
and early deaths.</p>

<p>"Your federal, state and city governments attempt to enforce laws but
are powerless against organized crime, because so many of your citizens
prefer criminal activity for its easy money. They control gambling,
narcotic drug sales and other illegal vices in lucrative territories by
their strong-arm methods or corruption.</p>

<p>"Many of you are deeply impregnated with the gambling and venture
habit. Octopus Colossus has invented many more avenues through which
you can give vent to this habit, other tempting pastimes, sports, and
devices to attract your earnings and bets, be they ever so small.</p>

<p>"Gambling is legally forbidden (except on your stock exchanges and
boards of trades); in most of your national states; in spite of that,
it is actively carried on in all its forms as you all know everywhere;
powerful gangsters reach and ever entice from the poorest and their
children. They also live in affluence and luxury and travel around in
expensive bullet-proof automobiles, and live in electrically guarded
and protected mansions.</p>

<p>"At your well known gambling dens of Monte Carlo, many spend the last
moments of their lives sitting in despair on the suicide bench before
jumping over the high cliff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>"Reno, Nevada, called "The Biggest Little City in the World," the
divorce capital of your country, has legal gambling of all kinds and is
wide open twenty-four hours a day. Gamblers two lines deep stand around
dice tables and roulette wheels, play at twenty-one card tables, and
bet on horse races. Many mechanical gambling devices and card games are
constantly busy, mostly on the receiving end.</p>

<p>"Here you can discern your extreme human weakness; in spite of the many
humorous warning posters in one of its most sumptuous gambling houses,
your rich and even your poor take gambling chances.</p>

<p>"Rich society men and women, business and professional men, low and
high paid workingmen and women, housewives, mechanics, laborers and
lumber camp workers, cowboys, old miners, Indians, Chinese, and
Africans—men and women of all ages, social security and state welfare
recipients in all kinds of attire, elbow each other as they stand or
sit alongside each other around these tables, gambling most of their
pay, savings, and pensions away. There are no limits on the bets, from
a nickel up to a thousand dollars. Gambling palaces, night clubs, and
saloons, all with gambling paraphernalia, seem to occupy most of the
largest and best stores and buildings in the business section as well
as in other commercial zones all over the state.</p>

<p>"Most restaurants, retail food stores, and drug stores have gambling
devices of some kind. Outside of mining, gambling may be the largest
paying industry for the whole state and its population. The federal
government, the state, county, and city governments of Nevada derive,
directly and indirectly, large taxes and license revenues from these
games of chance in every one of its cities and villages. If you Earth
people must indulge in that pastime, we here feel that it's very
commendable for these authorities to tax them.</p>

<p>"The gambling system in Nevada is praiseworthy, because it's in the
open and legal, whereas in all your other states, gambling is operated
clandestinely and on much larger scale, where they are thriving on
their pay-offs. They either buy protection from, or are in cahoots
with, politicians, officials, or police helping to greatly corrupt
government. Large numbers of visitors pour into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span> Reno from adjoining
and distant states for divorces and gambling purposes."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Washington, April 22, (UP)—Sen. Estes Kefauver, D., Tenn., said today
that the annual gambling "take" in the United States is reliably
estimated at $20,000,000,000.</p>

<p>Kefauver, in his weekly radio address to Tennessee, did not give the
source of his figure. But he said it amounts to nearly one-half this
country's budget. Crime and gambling have grown to such proportions
that a congressional investigation has become a "matter of urgent
necessity," he said. Kefauver is the author of a resolution to hold
such an inquiry—a resolution now pending before the Senate.</p>

<p>"We ought to cut out the cancer when gambling and crime reach the
point of endangering our system of government," he said.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>
</div>

<p>"These gambling losses do not include the billions lost on the stock
exchanges, and boards of trade.</p>

<p>"Your Octopus derives his blood soaked profits, from your poison
habits, as follows:</p>

<p>"The saloon and liquor lounge is your poor man's heaviest burden. It
not only takes away and robs him and his family of his meager earnings,
but it wrecks his health and turns him into either a criminal or a
drunkard. Every dime or dollar they extract from you means one nursing
bottle less for your babies, less food and medicine for your families.</p>

<p>"Thus come need and destitution. The saloon is one of the chief causes
of poverty and degeneracy, crime, insanity, and suicides. It is both
directly and indirectly the cause of the killing and injury of many
people.</p>

<p>"You may know from your own experience that after drinking a very small
quantity of an alcoholic beverage, you have an obnoxious breath. Nature
biologically did not intend alcohol for human consumption. It is an
unhealthy digestive irritant, stimulant, and narcotic.</p>

<p>"Seemingly many people from top to the bottom of your social strata
have fallen for the wiles of John Barleycorn and his side-kicks. At
sumptuous social functions and at the parties of the poor, alcohol is
freely consumed. It is served in the homes, cocktail lounges, night
clubs, cafes, and the cheapest corner bars. No home of the well-to-do
is fashionable unless it has the latest push wagon liquor service or
a permanent, small, drinking mixing bar. Alcohol drinking seems to be
the fad. The serving of alcoholic beverages is supposedly a sign of
hospitality.</p>

<p>"Afternoon and early evening cocktail hours are an important event to
patronize cocktail lounges and bars. Both sexes guzzle liquor and make
new acquaintances. Women and men companions of all ages, mothers who
are neglecting their children and homes, mothers with their daughters,
youths, businessmen, brokers, politicians, and clubmen mingle
with idlers, gamblers, bookmakers, policy operators, and narcotic
distributors, and other human vultures. All are fashionably attired
with assumed social graces and smooth voices. The smoky and noisy
atmosphere is drowned by music.</p>

<p>"The same kinds of crowds frequent the night clubs with sensually
contorted dancing and floor shows until early morning. That's where
some of you take your daughters, sweethearts, and wives, and you think
you are having a good time. That's where your daughters and sons from
adolescence to maturity go with their dates or to pick up dates. They
think it very smart. That's where they acquire pernicious habits.</p>

<p>"Look or walk into any of the great numbers of night clubs, high class
hotel cocktail lounges, or neighborhood saloons and you will see
daughters, sweethearts, wives, mothers, or sisters, of your friends
and perchance your own, sitting on stools around the bar or in booths,
close to known or unknown male companions. A man may take a girl out
for just a little moonlight spin in his waiting automobile and even
perhaps in a call house, a wayside cabin or in his bachelor apartment.</p>

<p>"In some of the sumptuous ladies' restrooms in the finest of these
places brothel and call house madams sometimes recruit their new
inmates.</p>

<p>"These are the fathers and mothers of your future generations.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span> Half
of your population in the near future may be prison, insane asylum,
or hospital inmates, and a great many of the rest may be atrocious
supermen of Hitler's type of moron.</p>

<p>"The best your federal, state, county and city governments can do is to
tax alcohol and liquor to the limit, which they commendably do.</p>

<p>"No wonder that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"On December 10, 1945, at Miami Beach, Florida, Edgar Hoover, Chief
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, bluntly warned the nation's
police chiefs that the United States is headed for a major crime
wave, with juveniles taking the lead in an era of 'Bloody' postwar
lawlessness.</p>

<p>"Here, at the convention of the nation's police chiefs, Hoover
revealed statistics showing an amazing increase in arrests of
bobby-sox girls of 18 and under. Hoover asserted that one out of
every twenty-three Americans had been criminally fingerprinted by
the F.B.I., whose files, he said, contain records of 6,000,000 such
persons. He cited figures showing that persons under twenty-one commit
15% of all murders, 36% of the robberies, 30% of all rapists, 34% of
thieves, 26% of the arsonists, and 62% of all car thieves.</p>

<p>"Hoover said arrest of bobby-sox girls under eighteen jumped 198%
since 1939, while arrests for boys in the same age group increased 48%
for homicide, 70% for rape, 72% for assault, 55% for auto thefts, and
101% for drunkenness and drunken driving.</p>

<p>"Lawlessness has taken on such proportions as to even startle the
imagination," he said.</p>

<p>"In Miami Beach, December 11, 1945, President Truman in a personal
message called on the nation's police officials to organize a
country wide crime prevention drive aimed at the roots of juvenile
delinquency. Mr. Truman said in the message read to more than 700
delegates to the International Association of Chiefs of Police
Convention that he looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span> upon the rise of juvenile delinquency as
perhaps the most alarming problem faced by law enforcement officers.</p>

<p>"Americans cannot afford to regard that problem passively or to
postpone the action necessary to its solution," the President said. "I
am convinced that the active cooperation of all welfare, religious and
social agencies, civic leaders, businessmen and citizens in the broad
national crime prevention program directed at the roots of the evil is
the path to be followed and without delay."<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>
</div>

<p>"Mr. Edgar Hoover, chief of your Federal Bureau of Investigation, and
your President Harry Truman know full well one of the main reasons for
these conditions; but with liquor and alcohol traffic protected by the
21st Amendment to your Constitution, with the strong financial interest
in the manufacturing and distribution of alcohol, and with the strong
propaganda which strengthens the desire for the existence of these
conditions, their hands as heads of Government and Investigation Bureau
are tied and powerless. They and your Congress would greatly hesitate
to try to do away with this evil, if doing so would close those
industries with their large numbers of workers out of work and bring
back prohibition conditions.</p>

<p>"Man's poison habits are often the cause of an innocent person losing
his life or being disabled through the recklessness of the moderate or
social drinker.</p>

<p>"Your Congress should at least pass, as soon as possible, a Federal law
completely outlawing the drinking of alcoholic liquor, no matter how
moderate, to anyone who has a driver's license for motor cars, buses,
aeroplanes, or any other rapidly moving vehicle and make it a crime
punishable with strict and heavy penalties. Driver's licenses should be
issued by the Federal government only, after a thorough examination.</p>

<p>"Tobacco is another avenue where your Octopus gains nearly four billion
dollars per year.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"If you smoke a pack a day, you inhale 400 milligrams of nicotine a
week."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>Said Dr. J.L. Myers of Kansas City, "Nicotine irritates the mucous
membranes of the respiratory tract. Tobacco tar injures those
membranes."</p>

<p>"Non-smokers, in four years at Yale and at Amherst, grew more in
height and weight and lung capacity than did their smoking colleagues."</p>

<p>Knute Rockne was definite: "Tobacco slows the reflexes, and any
advertising which says it helps an athlete is falsehood and fraud."</p>

<p>Habitual smokers have a 50 percent higher incidence of palpitation of
the heart than non-smokers. There is evidence that heart disease is
more prevalent among smokers than among non-smokers.</p>

<p>It is generally agreed that cancer of the mouth, tongue and lips is
unduly prevalent among smokers.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>
</div>

<p>"Study fire statistics from your fire insurance companies. They will
show you that most fires you have are started by smokers.</p>

<p>"One of the more sinister activities of the Octopus lies in relation to
drugs.</p>

<p>"The drug habit, as I understand, has been acquired by many on your
earth through your purchase and use of many cheap, unsuspected mild
patent medicines, or through your doctor's prescriptions for medical
purposes, or through the narcotic drug traffic by your gangsters, with
the connivance of some of your unscrupulous politicians. The Octopus's
slimy tentacles here surpass themselves. Once the habit takes hold of
its victim it is very hard to free him of it, and he becomes enslaved
to its use. Unless he gets his daily dose, his overpowering desire and
need for it become acute. In that state he will commit any crime to
obtain the drug to alleviate his acute hunger.</p>

<p>"Some of your doctors, nurses, medicine manufacturers, mostly your
gangsters are to blame. Those who, against human decency and law,
deliberately induce those tendencies are reprehensible human hyenas.
There is nothing so monstrous as the extreme lust and selfishness of
some of you who grind out profits through the suffering of your fellow
man. Through neglect or by design<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span> you turn him into a lifelong addict
so that you can live in affluent luxury and security. There is no
conscience guilt, compassion, nor pity, in your soul for him and his
babies; but inexorable retribution is bound to seek you out and have
vengeance against you and yours in your future progeny.</p>

<p>"Your intensive money-craving tends to cause you, when you are ill, to
hazard your health by delaying medical examination, by trying to cure
yourself with home remedies or patent medicines, very often risking
your health and life by postponement. For the lack of funds, you are
often at great disadvantage by not being able to procure competent
medical attention.</p>

<p>"Politics and certain politicians give the Octopus another stronghold.</p>

<p>"Earth—Man by instinct is not wicked, he is molded by environment
and force of circumstances. Beset with the stress of uncertainties
and insecurity of life. And with vicissitudes of selfishness, greed,
temptations, desires for riches and power. Contributive to the breaking
down in some of you of love, honor, chastity, character, honesty,
respect, ethics and morality.</p>

<p>"Your lack of our sense of thought reading, and under your present
moneyism system of life the best form of your earth government cannot
guard itself against isolated cases of weak, unscrupulous, and
treacherous persons.</p>

<p>"Some of your opportunists, amateur and professional politicians, with
the lust for wealth and easy money, seek and secure high offices,
and permanent soft jobs in your Government. Few hirelings of crooked
political bosses and machines reach high places in Government, or
attain them through political campaign work, contributions, fixed
elections, and dishonest political maneuvers.</p>

<p>"Some few do not hesitate while in public office, through inside
information and political maneuvers, to influence and benefit through
a rise or decline of stocks, bonds, commodities, and real estate.
They use it to speculate on the commodity markets tending to increase
food costs. They obtain high salaries, Government offices, and other
positions for their near and distant inexperienced relatives and
friends, and get kick-backs on their salaries.</p>

<p>"Few of them have procured their nominations and elections<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span> by paying
for them in advance or by promising future favors. They get your vote
by promises that very often are not kept. Some officials sometimes
have been tempted to accept bribes. Dishonest ones demand them openly
or by subterfuge. In return, they help individuals or organizations
to operate unlawfully. Some, in Government office, have helped to
contribute to crimes of the worst exploitation, and extortion, against
your nationals, or other nations.</p>

<p>"Your money packs the potentiality of the greatest power force and
medium for most all your evils and is a constant strong tempting
magnet staining with its putrid stigma of corruption, some of your low
and high pillars of your temples of justice, law, righteousness, and
benevolence, since historical times they have shaken its foundation and
toppled over the weak edifice you call civilization.</p>

<p>"No matter how impregnable your officials may be, their jobs are
difficult. There are always a few who sooner or later are tempted
by economic necessity or desire for social betterment to advance
themselves at the expense of their principles. The men resisting must
have the integrity of flint. It is unfortunate that the weak ones by
their action break down the good done by the strong. In your three
branches of government we find that the officials of the upper strata,
except for a few isolated instances, have kept their records clean.</p>

<p>"Your world history shows that dictatorship, unjust political, or
government ruling power nearly always caused political violence
and the early death of most of your leaders through revolutions,
assassinations, overwork, and extreme tension.</p>

<p>"Even your religions are not immune from its contamination. Your money
greed Octopus through his enticement has unlawfully violated and
corrupted your most sacred religious commandments and sacraments.</p>

<p>"Disrupting and weakening your safety protection is another function of
your Octopus.</p>

<p>"Property caused you to surround with guards all your government
departments and bureaus, and all your business establishments and
industry, from the largest to the smallest. Your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span> office, your home, in
fact, every building at immense costs is provided with all safeguards,
contrivances, and precautions.</p>

<p>"Your legislative departments everywhere have passed innumerable
stringent laws and created law enforcement departments of all kinds.
You have built your so-called impregnable safes, safe deposit vaults,
and burglar alarms. You have developed intricate and costly systems of
business protective methods; and services and guards of all kinds to
check and counter check every deal, item, and number of articles, down
to the last penny or article of the lowest value.</p>

<p>"You have insurance of all kinds against loss and fraud; real estate
title insurance, indemnity bonds, postal insurances. With all these
precautions, you are still vulnerable to loss through your most trusted
partners or employees, through your competitor, through unforeseen
circumstances, through dishonest and crafty speculative plots against
you by individuals, gangsters, or through a rapacious dictator, through
plundering governments, or through predatory national wars.</p>

<p>"The double latches on your windows or the double locks on your doors
do not always protect you. Day or night, awake or asleep, through all
the regions on your Earth, you are prey to the most atrocious crimes.
Alive or dead, your body is in jeopardy. Alive, you are in danger of
being blackmailed, kidnapped, or waylaid openly or from ambush. Some
will kill you for a few pennies or for your clothes; in a rooming house
in England, persons were murdered in order that their bodies might be
sold to dissecting rooms; and ghouls may desecrate your grave to sell
your body.</p>

<p>"The overwhelming temptation for the possession of money, wealth,
affluence and power is so great that all your laws, and enforcement
agencies are powerless against your criminal elements, with venal
tendencies in some members of your police departments, and in certain
members of large political organizations, one of them is reported to
be dominated by an underworld leader, and whose friends are appointed
to official positions, when a court witness can be intimidated or
murdered, when the services of a murderer can be ordered or bought, as
per a statement to your senate crime committee that there exists an
underworld<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span> nationwide Murder, Inc., when some of your law enforcement
officers, some of their superiors and some politicians associate with
and are friends and partners of criminals, when gangsters who not only
contribute to and are active in political campaigns buy protection, and
carry open shooting and bombing wars on the crowded streets of your
cities in the daytime, and when your most secret government and arms
information is easily obtained by other nations through your traitors
and their spies, you certainly have no law enforcing security."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Washington, (AP)—F.B.I. Director J. Edgar Hoover said today that
crimes in 1946 broke all records for the past decade. Every 5.7
minutes, there was a case of murder, manslaughter, rape, or assault to
kill."</p>

<p>"Major crimes in all categories throughout the country totaled
1,685,203 last year, an increase of 119,622 over 1945, he said in a
report. He noted this meant an average of one such crime every 18.7
seconds."<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>"Moscow, Ida., July 20 (UP)—A serious crime is being committed in the
United States every 18.7 seconds, Paul Shine, assistant F.B.I. agent
in charge at Butte, Mont., told Law Enforcement Institute delegates
today at the University of Idaho, here."</p>

<p>"Shine added that each day 36 persons are slain, 150 robberies take
place and 1,032 burglaries are committed."<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>
</div>

<p>"What about the numbers of hushed up, unknown and secret crimes?</p>

<p>"Your overcrowded prisons where you confine your adults and very often
in the same cells mixed with your juvenile offenders are breeding
places not only for many hardened criminals and murderers but also
habitual sex depraved fiends. Many of them become habitual drug
addicts, induced by their fellow prisoners, or by some of their guards
who sell the drugs.</p>

<p>"There is no need for me to detail all crimes and offenses for
material gain; where your Octopus excels in his violent and constant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
aggressiveness. Your newspapers every day, everywhere give you
innumerable, criminal deeds and happenings.</p>

<p>"You men may have been wondering why I have again gone into such
detail to sketch briefly some of the ills of the world in which you
have lived. You may feel that we Martians should consider the case
hopeless. But the contrary is true. Because there have been and are
many leaders of integrity and high principles in your midst, we feel
they should be commended and given the support of greater numbers of
your citizens. The paths of virtue, kindness and tolerance should be
made more attractive than the paths of dishonesty, vice and crime. Much
of the energy of your people is dissipated in activities of the Octopus
that destroy not only themselves, but those near them and around them.
We here in Mars believe that there are not enough of your citizens
awake and aware of what is happening. Many of those living in palaces,
beautiful suburbs, or in the quiet villages are not aware of the
crowded living quarters, the poverty and the ignorance of many of their
fellow citizens who live in the slums where fresh air and sunshine are
lacking, and sanitary conditions are most primitive, where your poor
are crowded in dark, filthy small living quarters, where large families
with many sick and diseased adults, children and animal pets live
together, communicating diseases to each other. These families barely
have enough for necessities, causing malnutrition, and desperation.
There is no privacy in their home life; parents and small and
adolescent children of both sexes live together in small apartments, in
tenement houses, cabins, and shacks, where families, and vice dens are
neighbors.</p>

<p>"Narrow, filthy yards are full of wash lines; streets and sidewalks
are crowded on both sides with pushcarts loaded with fish, fruits, and
vegetables and smelly eatables; gutters reek with rotting garbage, but
the poor man's club, the saloon, is at every corner, which gets most of
his earnings.</p>

<p>"This is fertile soil where crime and vice are born and flourish, where
venereal diseases are rampant, and where many of their daughters and
wives are forced or enticed to become drunkards and prostitutes. Vice,
disease and crime wave epidemics that begin in these slums, spreads
quickly to and within your own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span> neighborhood and you are not immune
from its contamination, suffering or falling its victim.</p>

<p>"Your money is the primary and only cause which creates some of
your greedy and hard driving executives and employers, disloyal,
distrustful, malicious, and wastefulness in some employees, false
friends, extreme envy, dangerous, and criminal covetousness, undue
influence, bribery, corruption, extortion, and brings into existence
among some of your so-called educated, ruling and leader classes
prejudices to an irrational influence and selfishness; in their social
intercourses, class struggles and human exploitation resulting in all
the evils of your world. From your infancy your cruel taskmasters
inculcated and built up in you a deeply rooted man-made system like a
quagmire into which you sink deeper and deeper.</p>

<p>"You are completely under the spell of your Octopus. You yield to
its will and influence. Your reason, intelligence, will, conscience,
emotions, in fact, even your soul is directed by its grasping
tentacles. He is the Godfather of 'Mammon' the Demon you worship, above
mother love, children's love, parent love, mate and brother love.</p>

<p>"Unless you drive these money changers out of your temple, chaos,
terror, forced slavery, annihilation of most of your humanity, complete
destruction of your present culture, inventions, and discoveries, all
that you have built and created will become rubble, and deeply buried
and earth covered. The few left of you will revert to the primitive
status of your primordial life.</p>

<p>"Indications point that the Octopus now even in his own stronghold,
there is the beginning of decay, but he is still all powerful, and full
of fight.</p>

<p>"My mental vision discerns beyond the distant horizon, after the storm
a rainbow, a ray of hope, with symptoms of a gradual change in his
fundamental functions."</p>

<p>Addressing himself to me, Sun-Rank Banard said, "Now Lieutenant
Balmore, I want to let you know that the President of our planet is to
tender you a farewell dinner before your departure.</p>

<p>"Among those invited will be the highest dignitaries, of all races
of Mars; they will include the President, his cabinet members,
supreme court judges, congressional leaders, representatives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span> of some
professional and craft academies, including some of our top scientists,
and some of our highest Sun Rank members, and not forgetting also
myself.</p>

<p>"They all look forward and are very desirous to meet and make the
acquaintance of men of their sister planet. You and your friends may be
called on and are expected to speak; especially on matters pertaining
to Earth conditions.</p>

<p>"We are aware that certain members of your crew were active in Germany
before and during the last War. Being that we all know in detail of all
the atrocious happenings, we would prefer that they would recount them
to us.</p>

<p>"You will be advised of the exact date."</p>

<p class="center"><i>False Civilization</i></p>


<p class="center">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Quos Deus vult perders dementat prius.</i></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Those whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad.</i></span><br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sun-Rank Banard</span> asked me if it would be convenient for us to make an
all around planet tour of visits to their different continents and
races. They all would like to welcome you before your departure.</p>

<p>We not only accepted the invitations for the tour but three of us also
volunteered to speak at the presidential banquet, so I handed in their
names to Sun-Rank Banard.</p>

<p>Next morning early we boarded our excursion plane for the first
itinerary of our tour. After landing at a large airport of another
beautiful large city, we were welcomed by their greeting committee,
with their band playing our national anthem, and our other triumphal
marching songs; while we were marching in a file to their large stadium.</p>

<p>Big crowds on both sides of our route and a great many body flyers
overhead, all noisily welcomed and respectfully saluted us.</p>

<p>Their decorated large stadium was packed to capacity of over one
hundred thousand persons. With the band leading us all around inside
the arena, we were greeted with loud cheering and sprinkled with
beautiful flowers, and all of them in their Martian language, wishing
me Bon Voyage, with my safe and quick return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>After marching around a couple of times, we were led to a large
outstandingly decorated front lower seating box, where we were received
in a most friendly and cordial manner by their dignitaries who asked us
to sit among them.</p>

<p>They then started their very interesting athletic games, and body
flying stunts.</p>

<p>All that day and until we boarded our airship, they outdid themselves
to entertain, to make us comfortable, and to show us around.</p>

<p>It took us a whole week with many stops to circle the globe; we were
treated, and received everywhere with the greatest honor and acclaim.
We arrived back in Amboria in time to bathe, rest, and get ourselves
ready for the evening banquet appointment.</p>

<p>Sun-Rank Banard with about a dozen of high rank officials arrived in a
large plane to escort us to the Presidential home.</p>

<p>The grandeur of the building, without a single guard, and the marvelous
outside, and inside decorations of that sumptuous palace, as well as
its large magnificent banquet hall and table service with the richly
dressed large assembly of notables was a beautiful and unforgettable
sight.</p>

<p>When we were announced they all stood up and gave us a cheer, and the
band started to play our national anthem in which they all joined in
its singing. To us it was a very impressive and grandiose feeling. We
were led to the head table on the dais, and each one of us was seated
between the most important of their citizens. My seat was between their
president and their vice-president.</p>

<p>Their food was excellent, all this splendor, inspiring in us a profound
admiration, it would take me too long to give details. After the
last course was served, Sun Rank Banard as toastmaster announced the
President as their first speaker. In a long eloquent speech, he not
only said that we were welcome as permanent inhabitants of Mars, but
also gave me his, and all Martians good parting wishes with the hope of
my success and return.</p>

<p>The toastmaster then announced that the guest speakers of the evening
will be some members of my crew who will give an account of some of
their experiences in Germany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>He then introduced Mr. Louis Richards, a former history professor on
Earth.</p>

<p>"Honorable President, ladies and gentlemen of Mars. I am overwhelmed, I
never dreamed that there were human beings on the other planets, and I
certainly never expected to be present on your globe speaking to such a
distinguished assembly of Martians.</p>

<p>"It is an outstanding feeling of honor to be the first earthman chosen
to address you. At this meeting and this banquet, it may not be a
pleasant subject to vividly present the suffering, misery and cruelty
on our planet.</p>

<p>"But being that we all here have a holy mission to fulfill, to save
all us earthmen in spite of ourselves, we are going to tell you only a
small part of what has occurred. The few of us here, earthmen, who were
sightseers of atrocious happenings on our planet, will recount to you
what took place.</p>

<p>"With the development on earth of sciences, physical strength gradually
became nullified so that skill, invention, and treachery became
uppermost in national diplomacy, battles, and wars with some of our
earth's nations.</p>

<p>"Since time immemorial we earthmen with our inherent and uncontrollable
addiction lusted to possess our neighbor's property by robbing,
killing, conquering, enslaving, and even eating him. In our constant
raids, bloody conquests, and feuds between families, tribes, and
classes, and aggressions between nations up to the present time, there
have been criminal and selfish conflicts, 'an endless circle of force,
retaliation, violence and war.'<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>"Exploration brought on our imperialism. In territorial aggrandizement
we conquered and exterminated large numbers of native populations, and
cruelly ruled, and exploited them.</p>

<p>"Our craving for power and imperialism has led us to the most cruel
wars, in which the flower of our youth has been killed or injured on
the battlefields.</p>

<p>"Since recorded history, there has been a long gruesome record of
billions of our men in their prime who lost their lives on the fields
of battle, and the most vigorous and virile of our young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span> men were
slaughtered and maimed. Both victors and vanquished were the losers.</p>

<p>"Our theory of the survival of the strongest is deceptive, for it
applies only to our wild and domestic animals.</p>

<p>"The weak, sick, feeble-minded, unfit, and old men left at home, plus
some of the crippled soldiers who returned were and are to a great
extent our progenitors. No wonder one of our senate committees got the
following reports:"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Washington, Aug. 26, 1946. (UP) The Army's top psychiatrist told a
Senate Committee yesterday, Gen. William C. Menninger, chief of the
War Department's Psychiatric Division, declared that—</p>

<p>1. Psychoneurosis was the basis for 43 per cent of the Army's medical
discharges. There were 300,000 men discharged for 'neuropsychiatric
reasons.'</p>

<p>2. Another 130,000 men were let out because of inadaptability or
ineptness, which, Menninger said, is 'another way of indicating that
personality factors did not permit them to fit into a job in the army.'</p>

<p>Washington, Sept. 19, 1945 (AP)—Major General Louis B. Hershey,
selective service director, disclosed today that:</p>

<p>Of boys nineteen and twenty years of age, 40 per cent were found to
have beginning sclerosis, or hardening of these organs. Of those
twenty-one to thirty years of age, 45 per cent had beginning hardening
of the liver, and 57.5 per cent had beginning hardening of the
kidneys. In the same age group, 40 per cent had confirmed hardening of
the kidneys, while only 10 per cent revealed both liver and kidneys
normal.</p>

<p>These findings, not on sick men, but on those who passed every test
and were considered perfectly well, reveal an important cause of low
vitality.</p>

<p>Among the young women who applied for admission to the Women's Army
Corps, there was similar disability. Each year we lose many more
persons from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span> preventable and premature deaths than we lost in battle
or from war injuries during the entire war.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>
</div>

<p>"Above are the fathers and mothers of our future generations. To our
money lust we can attribute the following shameful conditions:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Before the war, one American in 13 or 14 had either a sick mind
or a defective one. Now one in ten has crumbled. Not all will be
hospitalized. But doctors estimate that one American in 20 now alive
will spend some time in a mental hospital before he dies. That means
seven million Americans in mental hospitals—or headed there!</p>

<p>"We have today more sick and defective minds than there were soldiers
killed in all our wars from the Revolution through World War II. More
than half of all beds in all hospitals—whether equipped to handle
them or not—are occupied by sick minds. Yet, for every sick mind
in a hospital, there are 18 or 19 out of the hospital but who need
psychiatric care. Every staff doctor in state hospitals has, on the
average, 240 patients to care for. In the south central states, the
average number of patients to each staff doctor is 346.</p>

<p>"The fact is that it is our youth which is cracking up. Out of every
1000 young men called up by the draft, 178 were rejected as mentally
diseased or defective.</p>

<p>"Looking ahead, the psychiatrist foresees, only 20 years hence, some
16,500 senile insane and imbeciles pouring into the state hospitals
every year."<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>
</div>

<p>"Noah Webster, the lexicographer, must have been mistaken in defining
the word civilization as a 'reclamation from a savage state as being
cultured and refined.' He should have described it as a most horrible,
shocking, and brutal state.</p>

<p>"'They must have been men because they killed each other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span> and must have
been civilized because they did it frightfully'—said Voltaire.</p>

<p>"Our ancestors, the savage aborigines, men of the Middle Ages, and even
Nero, seem to us to have been barbarous. They were saints compared to
our present brutal kind. They would have been shocked had they foreseen
our present cruelty, in our modern, so-called civilized age.</p>

<p>"Our civilized age culture brought about the age of scientific
killings by some of our earth so-called civilized governments, by
gas asphyxiation on the battlefields, sinkings by submarines of
non-combatant ships whose innocent passengers floundered and drowned in
the troughs of the high seas, and without warning the bombardment of
open cities with the extermination of their blameless inhabitants.</p>

<p>"Having seen the perfect life on your planet, we feel a sense of shame,
guilt, and disgrace in the conduct of our fellow earth men. It never
seriously occurred to us that money lust was the primary cause of our
misfortunes. We never gave it a thought that we could live without it.</p>

<p>"Thanking you for the opportunity of letting me talk to you. You will
now hear from our following speakers of terrible happenings on our
planet."</p>

<p>The toastmaster then announced Mr. David Levy as the second earthman
speaker.</p>

<p>"Honorable President and Vice-President and distinguished Martian
representatives. If it wasn't that we are all here, trying to find ways
and means to help my fellow earthmen, I would feel ashamed to relate
what I am going to, but under the circumstances I feel it honorable.
I am a German-Jewish refugee, a member of a suffering earth sect. I
was in Germany before the war, and also a member of a contingent of
American troops in the start of its invasion.</p>

<p>"In spite of all our earthman's good religious teachings and
commandments, we have always been afflicted with superstition and
bigotry, until it has become a complex. Our apparently groundless
dislike of our fellow man leads us to regard him with antipathy,
enmity, and even hatred for imaginary grievances. We get prejudiced
against him because he may be of a different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span> nation, language,
religion, or color; or because he may not eat the same foods or wear
the same kinds of clothes; or because he may wear long hair or beard;
or because he may not follow our customs and manners. We take offense
against him for his abstinence, envy him for his sober progressive
industry, or become jealous of him for his studious qualities and
professional knowledge and success.</p>

<p>"Against these minorities and nations we first give vent to our
vengeance, by baiting him with the utmost cruelty to acquire his land,
property and wealth.</p>

<p>"A tragedy of a large remnant of my ancestors occurred in the year
70, when Titus of Rome conquered the agricultural nation of Israel,
taking them all away from Palestine to captivity in Italy. They were
not allowed to continue in the pursuit of their chosen agricultural
occupation, but were sold as slaves. On the fall of Rome they seem to
have been freed, and they wandered among all Christian countries of
Europe. Wherever they went, they were not allowed to purchase land
to follow their old occupation of farming and cultivation or to join
the labor guilds; they were forced to become money changers, lenders,
traders, or tax collectors.</p>

<p>"For long ages nearly all the great Christian religious bodies
condemned the charging of interest on loans; therefore, some of their
kings and feudal lords compelled the wanderers to become money lenders,
using them by subterfuge as instruments to hold other lords in their
power and to extort money from their people, and then taking the major
portions of collections away from the money lenders. Other lords
forcibly used them as tax collectors, all this starting, creating, and
intensifying hatred and enmity against all of them everywhere.</p>

<p>"Defenseless strangers, wanderers with a different religion, language,
and customs, they always were the scapegoats. They were then cruelly
subjected to contempt, injustices, tortures, and massacres. In 1492,
they were subjected to atrocious tortures by the Spanish Inquisition.</p>

<p>"Attila as King of Germany was called the 'Scourge of God,' and the
Germans were noted for their fierceness and destruction in their
ruthless plundering and destroying what was venerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span> of Rome. Attila
and his bands, no matter how merciless, were generous and gentle to
their victims compared to the draconian cruelties of their descendants,
a modern, so-called civilized and cultured people who took pleasure
in inflicting, in their civilized manner, the most outrageous and
atrocious criminal deeds on millions of defenseless and innocent
people. In the late 1920's Hitler, and his Nazi cohorts started his
propaganda.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"He (Hitler) saw in anti-semitism the principle and only means of
securing political power for himself and party; thus he achieved his
purpose by the most formidable and unscrupulous campaign accompanied
by the most ruthless violence and barbarity in the annals of history
that the world has ever seen.</p>

<p>"Having thus found anti-semitism an extremely valuable instrument for
easily securing wealth and political power in Germany, Hitler resolved
to utilize it for the same in fomenting it in foreign countries
too.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>"The Nazis vilified the Jews as the cause not only of local political
discontent and economic distress, but of all the world's major
troubles.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>"In few countries has there been such an intimate bond between
the Jew-baiting rabble and sedition as in the United States. The
activities of the German American Bund and the numerous fascist
groups, plus the recent tendencies of some political figures toward
the use of anti-semitism to discredit arguments and policies which
they opposed are all too well known to the American Public."<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>
</div>

<p>"President Von Hindenburg of Germany died on August 2, 1934. Hitler,
the paranoid demagogue, immediately seized control. In 1935 the
Nürnberg laws relating to race and citizenship were enacted. By the
last of these measures, citizenship was denied to Jews and they were
cast to be the first sacrifice to our War God. The Nazis first passed
stringent laws that no one take, send, or ship money or valuables
of any kind out of the country. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span> they notified their minority
elements to get out of Germany. The rich Jews, compelled to leave, had
to give them all their valuable possessions, and flee their native land.</p>

<p>"In 1938, with the annexation of Austria, the German government started
to round up in Germany and Austria all Jewish males from fifteen years
old to the aged, and held them for ransom in concentration camps. In
these camps, they were forced to swallow every day strong cathartic
pills; many of these inmates after a few days died on the latrines of
these camps from these medicines and from daily brutal beatings. Those
that had money or could raise it to buy themselves out were allowed to
leave the country.</p>

<p>"At the Buchenwald Camp, the old, the young, and the weak had to
join the others early every morning at stone quarrying, cutting out,
lifting, and moving heavy stones under the lashes of brutal foremen.
Late in the evening, exhausted from overwork, they were welcomed by
brutes on both sides of the gates with whips, who unmercifully beat
them over their faces and bodies. Relatives were not allowed to visit
them. Many of them committed suicide by taking hold of charged high
tension wires surrounding the camp.</p>

<p>"They all had a chance to leave the country, even those in the camps.
But most European nations, in fact most of our national governments,
all over the world, heartlessly closed their eyes, ears, and their
consciences, to the most extreme human exigency of the times; they
closed their frontiers and doors on them, denying them inviolable
asylum, with the exception of a certain few, restricting them to their
quota numbers.</p>

<p>"Our Earth nations remained neutral, have the citizens of these nations
raised any concerted general protest of indignation? Not even the many
members of our so-called humane or animal-rescue leagues made any howls
about it, as they certainly would have, had the Germans inflicted on
their hogs such 'cultured' tortures before the kill.</p>

<p>"During the American Revolutionary War, Haym Solomon, a Jew, gave
his fortune to help save its independence, but many supposedly good
American Christians tried their utmost to prevent the saving of
defenseless babies and children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The American Legion, The Daughters of the American Revolution, and
various labor unions, the majority of whose members were Christians,
passed resolutions to keep the door closed. Congressmen, thinking of
votes, not of lives, were unwilling to liberalize the immigration
policy. A group calling itself 'The Christian Mothers' carried on a
national campaign to prevent the bringing of Jewish children to this
country. As a consequence children who might have been saved by some
display of Christian charity died in concentration camps, in gas
chambers, in crematories.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>
</div>

<p>"The German war against Poland enormously increased the number of these
unfortunates from the conquered countries. Within nine months Germany
had closed tight all borders upon every one of them, even the richest;
and after taking away all their property, were turned into a national
wholesale human charnel slaughter house, where they were methodically
put in death traps in their camps, including all women and children.
World nations refused to harbor them, so the Nazis massacred them.</p>

<p>"Approximately a half million of the best looking young daughters,
wives, and mothers from the ages of 14 to 25, the flower of the most
beautiful Jewish women, were first selected and forcibly taken from
their homes to be compulsorily incarcerated in brothels. Those that
survived at the end of their usefulness, diseased and weakened, were
driven to their final doom and deliverance into the gas houses.</p>

<p>"Some of them by some luck succeeded in boarding a crowded refugee
ship about to sail secretly away. They stopped at every port, but
were refused landing. Many jumped overboard; but the others, by a
<i>coup-de-grace</i> to end their misery, were all drowned when at last
the wandering ship, as fate and treachery would have it, was sunk or
blown up by a treacherous party, in the Port of Haifa.</p>

<p>"All this was a very unpleasant narrative; it's sad but true. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span> hope
that you Martians will find a way to convert our earthmen to your
perfect pure and honorable way of life.</p>

<p>"I want to thank you for the opportunity and honor you bestowed on me."</p>

<p>The toastmaster then introduced Mr. Hans Schulberger.</p>

<p>"Honorable President, Vice-President and most prominent citizens of
Mars. I am Austrian born, was planted as a member of the Hitler SS
Corps to spy on them. I was present at their abominable cruelties and
I will give you an eye picture of some that took place at all the
concentration camps, with their charnel houses, gas houses, live steam
cells, human fat rendering trenches, execution chambers, and torture
instruments, where the Nazis practiced all kinds of tortures and cruel
medical experiments, tests, and exterminated six million Jewish men,
women, and children, plus millions upon millions of Poles, Russians,
and military prisoners of all our nations. Our newspapers' detailed
reports of many of the most gruesome massacres, will be found as

<p>"I will now tell you the mildest case of their cruelty that I saw,
which has been reported—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By Ann Stringer, UP Staff Correspondent, Nuremberg, January 2, 1946
(UP)—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>There was no screaming or weeping. A little child cooed with delight.
A couple watched him with tears in their eyes. Another boy, 10 years
old, fought back his tears while his father talked to him soothingly
and softly.</p>

<p>Then they all went to death the same way—naked, piled body against
body, the old and the young together. Undignified a death as their
persecutors tried to make it, the victims gave it their own dignity.</p>
</div>

<p>"That was a pogrom. That was how the Nazis tried to exterminate the
Jews, as told in an affidavit submitted to the war crimes tribunal by
the American prosecution today.</p>

<p>"The testimony came from Hermann Freiderich Graebe, former manager of
a Ukraine construction firm who now works in the United States. Graebe
saw the pogrom in Rowno, in the Ukraine, in July, 1942, and again in
Dubno in October the same year.</p>

<p>"It was at Dubno that the Germans piled the victims into a mass grave,
then machine-gunned them, Graebe said in his affidavits. He swore that
1,500 persons were killed daily.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The people got off the trucks and undressed upon the orders of an SS
man carrying a riding or dog whip," he said. "They had to put down
their clothes in piles, sorted according to shoes, top clothing and
under clothing.</p>

<p>"I saw a heap of shoes totaling about 800 to 1000.</p>

<p>"Without screaming or weeping these people undressed and stood around
in family groups, kissed each other, said their farewells and waited
for the SS man who stood near a pit thirty meters long and three
meters deep.</p>

<p>"During 15 minutes I heard no complaint or plea for mercy. I watched
a family, a man and woman both about fifty, their children about one,
eight and ten, and two grown daughters, twenty to twenty-four.</p>

<p>"The old woman with snow-white hair was holding the year-old child in
her arms, sighing to it and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span> tickling it. The child was cooing with
delight. A couple watched with tears in their eyes.</p>

<p>"The father was holding the hand of the boy about ten, speaking to him
softly as the boy fought his tears. The father pointed to the sky,
stroked the boy's head and explained something.</p>

<p>"In a tremendous grave other people were closely wedged together,
lying on top of each other. Nearly all had blood running over their
shoulders from their heads. Some were still moving. They lifted arms
or turned heads to show that they were still alive. The pit was
already two-thirds filled—I estimated it contained about 1,000 people.</p>

<p>"An SS man sat on the edge of the narrow end of the pit, his feet
dangling into it. He had a tommy-gun on his knees and was smoking a
cigarette.</p>

<p>"The naked people went down into the pit and climbed over the heads of
people lying there to the place where the SS man directed them. Then I
heard a series of shots ... the next batch was already approaching."</p>

<p>At Rowno, Graebe watched the liquidization of the ghetto: "I saw
dozens of corpses of all ages and sexes in the streets," he said. "At
the corner of a house lay a baby less than a year old with its skull
crushed. Blood and brains were spattered over the house wall.</p>

<p>"I noticed a farm cart with two horses. Dead people with stiff
limbs lay on the cart; their legs and arms projecting over the
sideboard."<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p><i>Nevada State Journal</i>, May 14, 1946. "We saw the notorious
concentration camp at Dachau and we saw many of the others. It was
like descending into a pit of inconceivable horror. There were the
torture chambers and suffocation rooms. There were the great yawning
furnaces, each bearing a neat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span> sign in German giving its capacity of
human bodies and working hours. There were the dog kennels and the
execution blocks.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the grisliest sight of all was the long row of huge boxes
piled to the top with gold fillings taken from the mouths of uncounted
victims who met death at the hands of the Nazis. On each box was the
official stamp of the Reich Bank.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>
</div>

<p>"Hitler and company were not only the most atrocious murderers, but
also the most audacious thieves. German workmen were paying him weekly
installments which were deducted for years from their wages for a
'Volkswagen,' a people's car, which they never received.</p>

<p>"All the foregone is not pleasant to hear. It shook my complacency,
but it was necessary for me to disclose these facts to you in their
nakedness with these terrible pictures as a warning.</p>

<p>"Our cruel, ignorant, and superstitious animal instinct combined with
our grasping money lust is the cause of it all. This greed will be our
eventual undoing. We always at all times hate somebody, and give vent
to our savageness in many different ways, such as burning old women as
witches at the stake, picking on weaker nations for plunder and war,
and visiting hatred, pogroms, insults, indignities, and injustices on
our minorities. It has been a constant round of wronging and injuring
others.</p>

<p>"Who could have predicted or believe fifteen years ago less then a
generation, in an era of our so-called civilization and Christianity,
that such atrocious inhumanity could take place?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">WHO IS GUILTY OF NAZI CRIMES?</p>

<p>"I have a high respect for the profession to which I belong, and the
reporting done by American and British correspondents during this
war, whether on the air or in the press represents a high mark in
journalism.</p>

<p>"Now these American correspondents, who are not engaged in spreading
atrocity stories, give detailed reports of the most cold-blooded mass
murder in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span> human history. This is not the first time that American
correspondents have told the world what was going on. They told of the
mass murders being committed in Germany, in 1933, and the world did
not listen.</p>

<p>"Members of the British House of Commons or the American Congress,
visited Nuremberg party rallies, sought audiences with Adolf Hitler
and came home to brag about them. A former American President visited
Hermann Goering, as did many American businessmen. They visited him
and some thought we could do business with the Nazis very nicely.</p>

<p>"No country severed relations with the Nazi government because it was
composed of murderers. The Nazi murders were merely internal affairs
and there were plenty of apologists for the persecutions of the Jews.
But the apologists of the persecutions are in some measure guilty of
what happened in Lublin.</p>

<p>"To many persons Marshal Petain is still an elegant old gentleman and
touching figure. Yet his government knew what it was doing when it
rounded up, first German refugees, and later anti-Nazi French Jews and
delivered them to the gestapo. The mass murderers presented a list and
the Vichy government delivered the list. Can their hands be altogether
washed of the blood spilled in Lublin?</p>

<p>"And how about the countries that barred their frontiers, when these
people, for 10 full years, before and during the war, were trying to
escape from doom? Ships full of them floated like flying Dutchmen in
an oceanic void, and no harbor would receive them.</p>

<p>"The guilt lies also with those who actively collaborated with the
crimes without endorsing them, washing their hands of blood and
publicly whitewashing the criminals.</p>

<p>"Every individual bears a responsibility for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span> whole of mankind.
Human civilization is based on the recognition of that responsibility.
The moment anyone denies this responsibility he makes himself an
accomplice of humanity's crimes."<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>
</div>

<p>"We can't lull ourself to the idea that we now are immune from
subversive order. We cannot feel sure and depend upon it that we are
safe anywhere from money, wealth, and power grasping gangsters. Some
of them get into high places of government. Germany was considered
Christian, a highly educated, and cultured country; yet a gang of
berserk criminals calling themselves supermen banded together to
control the government, first taking the property and wealth away
from their defenseless innocent Jewish minority and killing them,
then subjugating their supine people. Other despotic gangsters with
their strong-arm torturing secret gangster police are now in control
of governments of some of our nations and are holding its peoples in
bondage, and in forced slave labor. The perfidy and hypocrisy of those
in government power of some of our nations has become so aggravated,
that humane benevolence, and justice have become a sham and completely
vanished.</p>

<p>"With our new death-dealing, destructive armaments and our annihilating
atomic power, how can we tell when some cruel gang dictatorship
government may enslave us, our children, and our coming generations?
Our people who may read this, what assurance and security have they
that a similar sinister, or worse fate and calamity will not befall
them, and maybe sooner than they expect? It happened and is now
occurring in certain countries of our world, we have many subversives
who eagerly are waiting for the opportunity to overthrow, head, and
control our government.</p>

<p>"Since you brought us to your planet, we have been pleasantly amazed
by your wonderful way of life, which we have seen, closely observed,
and studied from all its angles. We now have learned, and know the real
cause of our earth's misruled moneyism life system.</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen, we have given you a summary of our earth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span> troubles and
showed you their causes and abuses. I am sure no one can dispute the
facts. I hope they are convincing enough.</p>

<p>"There is no need for me to emphasize, and I agree with Sun-Rank
Banard, that our money, and exploitation systems are the real,
contributive motives of our ills. They are festering cancers, eating
away the vitals of the civilization we are vainly trying to build. I
want to thank you for the opportunity you gave me to tell you what
I have seen, hoping that you Martians will help save us from the
miserable life condition on our earth."</p>

<p>All Martians present were unnerved and some in tears, and in a state
of stupefaction. At the finish of the banquet they all greeted us in a
most friendly manner.</p>

<p>Sun-Rank Banard, approaching me, said, "One of our inter-planetary
airships is ready to take you back to your planet Earth. We all here
wish you Bon Voyage and good luck, and just signal us by wishing,
whenever you want to return here, and we will be glad to bring you back
again."</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><i>Another Trip to Mars</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">In an important</span> letter to me from Lieutenant Balmore from San
Francisco, he wrote—</p>

<p>When I left you some time ago, I made a trip to the West coast. In the
veterans hospitals I contacted many disabled veterans who had just
returned from the battle fields in Korea. I had known many of them
in the old days. I told them in detail about my experiences in Mars.
I told them of my plan to take a group of them back with me to Mars
to verify my experiences. Of course they were skeptical at first.
But after I had presented my cause more clearly they were convinced
there might be something to my plan. Most of them had nothing to lose.
Because of their own contact with war and their own ruined lives, they
were keen to save their children from the same fate, once and for all.
"But where will you get a plane to contact the Martian Airship?" they
asked.</p>

<p>I begged them to give me ten days time; I felt confident I could
procure a plane by some means or other. We have set the day and hour
to meet the Martian airship in the stratosphere. Thus far I have been
making plans in utmost secrecy, but I am afraid I shall now fail unless
you agree to help me. Could you use your influence to help us get this
plane? You have been my friend and believed in me. You offered any
assistance possible. Here is your chance, not only to help me, but also
join us on the trip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>I immediately took the next airliner to the West coast to consult the
Lieutenant and his friends. On my arrival I learned that one of my
best friends, an influential Congressman, happened to be there at the
time. I contacted him and after a long conference, he decided for us to
make a hurried trip to Washington. That night we left for the Capital.
At the same time the Congressman arranged our appointment with the
President for the next day.</p>

<p>At the secret conference the President, although not entirely
convinced, agreed to help us. It was decided the congressman and I
would make the trip to Mars. We returned to San Francisco quickly.
The congressman made arrangements for a large government bomber to
leave the Hamilton Army Airbase on the appointed day; he interceded
for Lieutenant Balmore with the proper authorities. The Lieutenant
regained his pilot's license. However, for some unexplained reason, the
government ordered the removal of the secret high-frequency mechanism
from the radio transmitter of our plane.</p>

<p>For ten days Lieutenant Balmore concentrated in an effort to produce
impulses of magnetic thought waves, strong enough to reach Sun-Rank
Banard's mind and impress upon him the urgency to meet us at the
appointed time and place. The fear that he would fail nearly wrecked
him. I was not relieved from my anxiety, until, on the appointed day
when our plane went up into high altitude, and spotted the Martian
airship.</p>

<p>The President after a closed conference with his cabinet members,
leaders of congress, and representatives of the United and Associated
Press, planned for them to follow us in another plane. They wished
to take pictures of this epoch making inter-planetary human contact.
They had a good opportunity to observe and photograph our plane being
absorbed in the Martian airship, and its instant speedy disappearance
into space.</p>

<p>On the trip, and on our landing on Mars, and after our quarantine
period, we were all overjoyed to meet and make the acquaintance of
Lieutenant Balmore's former crew, some of whom were friends of our
fellow passenger veterans. They introduced us to their Martian girl
friends and to many prominent Martians who gave us a royal welcome,
and made us comfortable in one of their most sumptuous hotels. During
our two weeks stay on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span> planet, we were not only welcomed to all
their continents by all their races like conquering heroes, but we
also attended continuous conferences with Sun-Rank Banard and other
important Martian personages. We made careful, exhaustive observations
and critical explorations of the planet. We checked in detail their
ways of living and system of government.</p>

<p>During our explorative travels, the Lieutenant found many chances to
rest and to be with Xora.</p>

<p>The Congressman, after our first dinner, was puzzled. He did not fully
grasp their way of life. He was amazed at an occurrence which took
place in their dining room.</p>

<p>The Congressman had taken along with him some gold coins, intending
to verify Lieutenant Balmore's statement that the Martians do not use
money. Finding the head attendant alone after dinner, he complimented
him on his service and put in his hand a few gold pieces. The butler
with the utmost courtesy returned the money to him and said, "I want to
assure you that your satisfaction with the way I rendered my services
to the family and to you is in itself a reward."</p>

<p>The congressman turning around to me said, "So Balmore was telling the
truth. I wouldn't have believed there was a servant who didn't have his
hand out."</p>

<p>After the dinner, Sun-Rank Banard took over. I am going to give you
briefly the summary of a very interesting discourse delivered to us by
Sun-Rank Banard, which I took down in notes.</p>

<p>"Mr. Congressman, I can follow the state of your mind, you are
bewildered. Let me answer one of your thoughts, and then I will explain
what is uppermost in your mind.</p>

<p>"You were first wondering at our having no servant problem. We have
no servants and no such problems; all our house attendants feel it an
honor to do their duties as experts in their calling.</p>

<p>"There is no master or servant feeling on Mars. The attendants of
homes, and workers of factories and shops have the right to be
transferred if they are not happy or satisfied in their jobs. A
transfer seldom happens; but if it does, it is always done in a
generous manner and friendly spirit. Servants get the same food here as
we do, and entertain their friends here with the same food and services
that we get. In my grade days, I also had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span> honor of performing
similar service to a high ranking member.</p>

<p>"Furthermore, our head attendant acted very tactfully, because it is
dishonorable and offensive for us to receive any material thing as a
reward for service. It lowers us to the servile standard. If merited,
the reward or gift which is appreciated and looked for is an honorable
promotion in points to a higher degree. In fact, there are no gifts
given to anyone, except children."</p>

<p>The Congressman then replied, "First, from what I have observed of
your ways of life, it looks to me as if you Martians live a regimented
existence; we earth people have liberty, and are free. I want to be
frank with you. I am somewhat confused. Do you use no money at all on
your planet? How do you measure value and what medium of exchange have
you? That same butler, or your cook, how does he measure the value
of his labor and service? And how do you measure it and what do you
give them in exchange? You Martians must have some medium of exchange
to give your people, a strong incentive to do good, honest work and
service, to excel, to improve, to research, and to invent so that they
can benefit and better their conditions of life.</p>

<p>"They must need enough money to insure their future independence and
to protect them and their families in their old age. With what do you
purchase necessities and luxuries? We on Earth get the intensive desire
to earn, and accumulate money or capital. This desire is a strong
driving power which incites us to do good work or service, to invent
new and necessary improvements, and to make scientific discoveries.
We do all this for gain and profit in moneys and capital, which we
save, invest on interest, in property, or in other profitable or risky
enterprises, and even speculate with on the future development or
increase in value of our investment. We even gamble on chances to win.
Most of us try to gain honestly and legitimately, but a great many of
us attain gains otherwise. We are like squirrels with their animal
instinct for putting away for a rainy day.</p>

<p>"I am also curious to know, what kind of a life system you people had
in the remote past, and by what process was it developed to its present
standard?"</p>

<p>Sun-Rank Banard answered, "After I get through giving, and showing you
an account of our life now, I will answer your last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span> question. Let's
look at this question of money first. The squirrels and other animals
have the right instinct, and we here have copied them. They, in time
of plenty, reserve and store away food. But this is food necessary for
their body consumption, not gold, silver, copper, or paper money for
which they have no use. They cannot eat or cover themselves with it.
Neither do they defy the laws of nature, like the few of you on Earth,
who control and monopolize your natural resources and productions to
the exclusion of the rest of you.</p>

<p>"Not all people on earth get benefits from hard work. Not always does
the inventor gain from his invention. Many of those that have reached
affluence, got there through inheritance, influence, politics, or
dishonesty. Their ambition seems to be to acquire wealth with which
to exploit and enslave their fellow men, by selfishly planning and
controlling, in rigid forced patterns, your managed economy.</p>

<p>"Humanity, and even certain animals on our planet, and on your earth
have more or less a development of emotional urges to surpass, outdo,
and excel each other.</p>

<p>"On your earth a great many of you use these impulses, and sagacity
to gamble on your money chances to win it away by fair or foul means
from each other. Whereas on Mars this impelling instinct is spent in
athletic games, studies, employment, endeavors, creative faculty,
inventions and researches solely for our mutual benefits.</p>

<p>"But that is not answering your question. You will be surprised at
the intensive driving force and zeal our citizens have for work which
will improve living for all of us. They are our guiding principles and
spirits.</p>

<p>"Our people respect themselves and respect others. Our workers feel
they are part and have a share of something big. They are filled with
the idea of making their part of this planet the most progressive
anywhere. Each person depends on the best efforts of the other fellow
in order to do the best himself.</p>

<p>"Our chief altruistic desires are for achievements and conveniences, to
serve, to create universal justice and equality, to better the lives of
all our humanity on Mars and to make their lives happier, contented,
and more independent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>"We have no special panacea to preserve our mental force, physical
vigor and long life. Our intensive life-saving health-giving medical
research and new discoveries and the regulated and hygienic life we
impose on ourselves. The rules are made by our health authorities and
guided by them. They start before our progeniture, even before the
meeting, marriage, or mating of our parents. The future of our race is
a most important matter to our administration and to all Martians.</p>

<p>"During the adolescence of our youths and maidens they are carefully
watched. They constantly undergo strict physical and mental
examinations and tests. They are allowed to marry only when they
have reached their prime of vigor and progeniture and are free from
inherited mental and physical ills. During this period they undergo
special physical exercise and treatments. They must pass satisfactory
physical and mental examinations to prove their fitness before they are
allowed to choose their mates and become parents of our children. We
practice our latest sciences of euthenics for the advancement of our
races, to prevent transmission by inheritance, or otherwise, of mental
and physical diseases.</p>

<p>"We guard the progeny of our children as you do a pedigreed herd of
cattle or an apple orchard. You choose the best and healthiest seeds,
and as the trees grow, you prune them and prevent them from flowering
and producing until the trees are developed, and strong. Such unions
are allowed only when their ages differ no more than ten years from
each other. We let natural sexual desire between young couples have its
course only on the recommendation of our medical authorities.</p>

<p>"When they have such feelings, either she or he, without shame or
disgrace, tell their parents before they enter into a marriage
union. If they are found insufficiently developed either mentally or
physically, they are kept separate and are given special physical
training, and medicines to overcome such passions until they become
matured.</p>

<p>"They always have genuine mutual desire, esteem, and love for each
other. On your earth many of you marry for financial gain, or for
social and family advancement. That does not happen on Mars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>"When they file their intentions to marry (they must be of the same
race) they take special courses in family relationships and home
making. These courses not only teach them how to conduct their future
general intercourse harmoniously, but also teach them how to be good
mothers and fathers.</p>

<p>"We want only children of young couples who are in their prime. Couples
with the best physical and mental health who can transmit to their
offspring their youthful energy and power. All others are prohibited
from procreating. Under these conditions we bring into our world
mentally and physically healthy and sturdy future citizens of Mars. We
encourage early marriages, thus eliminating the hunger aroused by the
mating instinct. Celibacy is a disgrace among us, with the exception of
the very aged.</p>

<p>"From the time of conception until the birth of her child, the mother
is carefully taken care of by our medical authorities. She must lead
a quiet secluded life without any excitement and must take special
treatments and foods so as to build up in herself and her unborn child
good health and a balanced nervous system.</p>

<p>"From their natal day, we watch carefully the development of these
children. Through their infancy, they are nourished at their mothers'
breasts. They receive her love and affection in a tranquil home.
Children are brought up in a quiet and harmonious home, where no fear,
tension, or excitement is instilled in them.</p>

<p>"Qualified medical inspectors make frequent visits to these homes;
where there is any suspicion of conditions prevailing which may
be injurious to the child, that child is taken away to our infant
institution, where it gets the best care. In our schools, we allow
no high pressure cramming and straining of mind, nerves, and sight.
Children are slowly and carefully taught the subjects easiest for them
to absorb, and for which they have an aptitude.</p>

<p>"Expert tutors, specialists in different subjects, are assigned to help
them in studies which may be difficult for them. We know the dangers of
overloading the young developing mind. Some minds develop sooner than
others. Nature has a way of its own, in that respect. Our educational
facilities are there to help but not force. It is not always the
earliest proficiency which is the best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>"As the child grows up, we train him with tact and love; under no
circumstances do we allow any feeling of inferiority, fear, or hate to
develop. Teachers are coalescent with our students. Fear does not enter
into our school curriculum. We give the students, student government.
They learn from the start, self control and obedience and the rudiments
of governing.</p>

<p>"In this way, thousands of years ago we succeeded in divesting
ourselves of the primitive animal fighting instinct. We have
strenuously discouraged the spirit of combativeness. We do not have
nor will we allow any offensive or defensive exercises, exhibitions,
or contests such as your brutal boxing and wrestling shows. We do not
have any offensive or defensive instruments, arms, or weapons, since
we have no need to master anyone among us. The spirit of combativeness
is totally absent in our exercises; we do not train ourselves in your
sciences of offense and defense. Violence of any kind is unknown.</p>

<p>"We are brought up in a healthy, pleasant environment, by affectionate
parents who inculcate in us the feelings of serenity, happiness, and
reverence for old age, and who guide us toward chastity, patience,
politeness and obedience to superiors. Our parents and teachers train
us in human relationship, how to become likable personalities, so we
can get along with our fellow beings. Our teachers stress friendship,
unselfishness, honor and loyalty. Our strict health regime keeps us
healthy and free from irritability. As a result, we live in a spirit of
unselfishness, loving and helping each other in the highest degree of
brotherhood.</p>

<p>"The science of human relationship referred to by your late President
Roosevelt, in a speech written before he died, but never delivered, was
long ago mastered by us. In school we take courses in human relations.
Our frequent attendance to lectures by our eminent psychologists has
helped to develop in us the most harmonious connubial and social
intercourse.</p>

<p>"We have no teen age problems because of our carefully planned
childhoods. I have heard about your places of correction for adolescent
children. To us it seems an indictment of your method of child
training. The parents rather than the children should be punished.
Our visitors from your earth have been telling us many things about
your youth problem. They were much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span> impressed with our lack of such
problems. A Martian cannot visualize adolescents as murderers, robbers,
committers of petty crime. Your habit-forming drugs and stimulants no
doubt help to increase your juvenile delinquency. I was amazed to hear
from one of you that statistics show your seventeen-year-olds come into
trouble with the law more than any other age group.</p>

<p>"We do not coddle our youths; their bodies and strength are developed
with careful and continual exercise and under strict discipline. We
force no square pegs in round holes, nor round pegs in square holes.
After their periods of education our young boys and girls are examined
by experts from the professional and crafts academies, who take great
pains to discover their natural talents and aptitudes so that they can
not only be of great service to us but a satisfaction to themselves.
We help them pass through training necessary to perfect them in their
chosen careers. We try to develop their ingenuity.</p>

<p>"Every profession or craft is controlled by an academy for each race.
The members of these academies are the governing powers and judges of
promotion and demotion. They honestly promote and reward only those
who are justly deserving. No one among us would want to be treated
otherwise. Whereas some of your own best known colleges of learning
will take poor students who are proficient in football or other sports.</p>

<p>"Up until the age of thirty Earth years we are still minors in our
educational period; after that our boys and girls must volunteer into
the general army of service. This service includes menial jobs, such
as working as farm hands, laborers, servants. It also covers all
general labor, such as city cleaning, dishwashing, rubbish assorting,
fertilizer and garbage handling. The girls must do the menial work
in hospitals as nurses' assistants or aides. All boys and girls,
gain their points according to their willingness to excel in their
work during their testing period. Almost all of them are fired with
enthusiasm and have a strong incentive to do good work. After a year
they become first grade degree citizens of Mars; then they go back to
their chosen or original trades or professions as apprentices.</p>

<p>"All of us on Mars go through the same routine. We are supposed to have
graduated from all grade schools, educational,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span> trade, agricultural,
and professional—and colleges of the highest learning; but not from
postgraduate courses, which we continually take after we have already
chosen our future vocations.</p>

<p>"Every grade degree has its honorary emblems, which we wear as a badge
of honor to denote our standing.</p>

<p>"Coming back to my discourse on the army of volunteers, I failed to
explain that until we pass our period of services, we are still at
home with our parents. But when we graduate from this service army, we
are given the privilege to select our future home in any locality or
community available among our own race. If we are married, we occupy
our home immediately; if not it is reserved for us for a limited time
until we marry.</p>

<p>"We file our requisitions for the available furniture and furnishings
of the style we like best, for all necessities and even for certain
luxuries, all of which contribute to our life of comfort and
contentment."</p>

<p>"And all that without paying for it in money?" asked the congressman.</p>

<p>"Yes," Sun-Rank Banard replied. The receiver is a citizen of Mars and
he is entitled to it.</p>

<p>"Every Martian from the day of his birth is issued ration books which
are renewable. As his requirements increase, he gets additional books
for his general necessities; but his constant requirements he gets as a
matter of right without ration book points. Sometimes, but very seldom,
certain scarce foods and drinks are rationed for a short time.</p>

<p>"From our first grade degree on, we get two Martian months of vacation
each year, either all at one time, or one month each half-year. We wait
our turn, and then we may go wherever we choose with our families. We
may go to camps, to mountains, or seashore resorts. Or we may go on
tours to other continents or other sections of our globe by plane or
ship. On these we also receive all comforts and services free.</p>

<p>"These and other privileges are temporarily denied anyone who infringes
upon our laws and rules. With all the good life we enjoy on our planet,
we find isolated cases reverting to primitive instincts; but because of
our thought reading sixth sense, we catch them before their offenses
become serious. These characteristics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span> by training, and evolution are
gradually disappearing.</p>

<p>"After starting in as apprentices, we are promoted point by point
from one grade degree to another, as we merit advancement. We are
compensated not only by being promoted to advanced positions in our
vocations, but also by receiving honorary degrees.</p>

<p>"Unemployment is unknown among us, even though our population is large.
All of us, even our aged, put in our full four hours of work and
service daily, and our disabled and crippled also put in their full
employment time into suitable trained occupations. We on Mars go in for
specialization. For instance, in agriculture, we have specialists in
orange groves who raise oranges only. It is the same in the production
of every different kind of fruit, vegetable, tree, animal, or fowl.</p>

<p>"Of those in the medical profession, more than two percent of us are
doctors of medicine. There are many more specialists. For every fifty,
or less, adult Martians, or for 25 couples and their families, we
have one general practitioner and one nurse. If we feel that more are
needed, we increase the number of medical students as required.</p>

<p>"These general practitioners are responsible for the prevention of
sickness, and for their cure. They can always call to their assistance
specialists.</p>

<p>"In the dental and other body-curing professions we have no less than
one doctor for every two hundred of our inhabitants with the same
responsibilities as the general practitioners. I understand you have
one to every 800 persons in the United States, the highest rate of any
Earth nation.</p>

<p>"We have specialization in industries and in professions. Our system
tends to make each one of us expert in his line, so that we not only
improve the quality but also increase the quantity of production and
services. Earth men, unlike us, cannot produce so many experts because
nearly half of your population are wasting their time either in
non-essential work, 'easy' jobs, or living at the expense of others.</p>

<p>"On our planet everyone, from the day he graduates from our schools to
the time he becomes infirm and helpless, keeps fully occupied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>"Old cities, which I remember, have been totally destroyed and
reconstructed nearly every generation, or sooner. This constant
installation of new and improved living appliances and the changes
in our general way of life have created for us a bee-hive of energy,
industry and activity in creating better and safer patterns of living.
Our young or aged like on your earth do not listlessly hang around
homes, barrooms, or streets, dying before their time from the lack of
physical and mental activity. We all aim toward a more or less creative
and realizable goal, whose advancement contributes to our social good.</p>

<p>"Should it become irksome or monotonous for a person to do the same
thing all the time, as in many instances it does, he or she may
take theoretical and practical courses in other endeavors under the
tutelage of our expert aged. Many of us remain all our lives in the
same professions and crafts. Our work is not wearisome, because we put
in but four hours a day, and have plenty of time for study, music,
recreations, pleasures, rest, and religious worship. The poorest worker
of our first grade is better compensated and is happier than your
richest man. Please contrast these two; and I leave it to you to make
your own judgment.</p>

<p>"Let us take at first the parvenu of your earth, who may have been poor
and undernourished at one time. He works all day and part of the night
under terrific high pressure, always scheming, worrying that someone
will steal his invention, trade, or customers, or get his contracts
cancelled or broken. He is under constant fear and excitement and
spends sleepless nights. He is even tempted to commit unethical or even
criminal acts to succeed.</p>

<p>"Due to his hard work, nervous tension and emotional stress, he may
become an insomniac, drug, alcohol, coffee, or tobacco addict. These
habits are contributive factors to digestive stomach troubles, high
blood pressure, irritableness, heart diseases, cancer, and early death.</p>

<p>"When he has acquired his ill gotten gains, he worries how to keep
them. He is afraid for his very life; many of your rich people are
afraid to sleep alone at night. He surrounds himself with all kinds
of safeguards and bodyguards. Why, a great many of them are afraid of
their own immediate families! His old age<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span> is not secure. It would take
me too long to tell you how our lowest grade members or first grade
degree members live. When you see them in our city life you will agree
that your richest man would immediately change places with one of them.</p>

<p>"We are one nation of many races. We have one constitution; and we
have one set of fundamental laws and rules for all inhabitants of our
entire globe. There are no separate laws and rules and property laws,
like those in your different states, counties, and cities. We have
no complex money value fluctuations like yours, which often affect
adversely your own economic and social welfare, as well as create
chaotic conditions. We have only one government, one house of council,
which changes every four years.</p>

<p>"Every citizen is the full responsibility of all of us, and he is of
the utmost value to us. Every able-bodied person on Mars is answerable
for the welfare of each one of us.</p>

<p>"I hope I have made myself clear. You will see, hear, and learn more
about our way and mode of our lives when you start to mingle with our
citizens.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, we have a very important congressional meeting this
afternoon. Before your departure, it may be a very interesting
legislative procedure on another planet for you to witness. I have
reserved a special section of seats for you.</p>

<p>"Let's now adjourn for lunch, and I will continue my lecture after
dinner tonight."</p>

<p>That evening Sun-Rank Banard continued as follows:</p>

<p>"You Earth people make and use your most important researches and
discoveries, only in times of danger and stress. But we have developed
and intensified our <i>esprit de corps</i> so that at all times,
we have the enthusiasm and ambition to compete with each other in
inventions, scientific researches, and discoveries. We take intense
pride in our work and join in competition with an eager spirit. After
our invigorating night's sleep, we are in the prime of our physical and
mental health, without worry, and in a serene, peaceful state of mind;
we start with a happy spirit our daily occupations.</p>

<p>"We do not allow any possibly injurious games, shows, or occupations.
Our people are not allowed to work at any machine or industry where
there is a hazard to health, or a possibility of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span> injury. No machine
is adopted until it has been absolutely injury proofed. We have
safeguarded them 100%. We are reasonably sure that every person in his
employment has the utmost in safety and healthy surroundings.</p>

<p>"Our aim is to enforce, and do our utmost, to keep us all in the best
of health, to guard, and preserve life. We prevent, and it's unlawful
for us to take any chances of possible accidental injury or death, in
all our labors, sports, and in our general ways of life.</p>

<p>"The industrial disabilities and deaths for your own nation, for the
year 1943, according to your Congressional Statistical Abstract 1944-45
was 2,414,000 disabilities and 20,100 permanent incapacities and deaths.</p>

<p>"We have no slow-ups, nor do we allow high pressure work in our
productions and industries. There is perfect harmony between
workers, foremen, and executives, who do and must rate high in
human relationships. Only the best of work is tolerated. With very
few exceptions, and only in most extreme emergencies or important
researches, do we allow more than four hours a day employment, and if
necessary, we arrange it into four shifts. Neither do we allow anyone
in an occupation which might excite or create in him tension.</p>

<p>"You Earth people try your utmost to continually increase the quantity
of your individual worker's production through his own energy and by
always adding and inventing new labor-saving methods and devices and
machinery. By this method you can do away with the services of many
workers and hire one to do the labor of many. At the same time, you
have a terrific waste on account of a considerable number of constant
labor turnovers.</p>

<p>"You offer a premium on high pressure mass production and increase pay
for overtime hours. Thus you use up your worker as you do a machine;
and I dare say you are more careful of the latter. After your workers
have given you their best energy and become weakened, they are thrown
out on the junk pile.</p>

<p>"Even though he may be in the prime of his post-youthful age, he cannot
secure employment in the calling in which he is experienced. Your
greedy industries demand only youth in its prime of energy; young men
who can stand the grind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>"If we find that an occupation is a little too strenuous for one
person, we divide it between two or more. Our machinery and inventions
are used solely for the convenience of our workers—to make it easier,
safer, and more comfortable for them. We would rather destroy and
rebuild and improve this entire city than allow it to remain a jeopardy
to even one person; whereas you Earth men are constantly threatened
by the hazards of your daily existence. There are no sinecures among
us; all of us are dependent on each other, but no individual is
economically dependent on any one of us for necessities, luxuries or
security. That kind of dependence is non-existent.</p>

<p>"Your words, <i>money</i>, <i>investment</i>, <i>interest</i>,
<i>cost</i>, <i>pay</i>, <i>price</i>, <i>salary</i>, <i>wages</i>,
<i>taxes</i>, <i>debts</i>, <i>profits</i>, <i>rebates</i>,
<i>charity</i>, <i>rich</i>, <i>poor</i>, <i>bankruptcy</i>, etc., are
not in our vocabulary or our dictionary.</p>

<p>"As part of our careful judgment and planning, we have made a strict
enumeration of inhabitants of our globe, listing in detail sex, age,
occupation, and daily births and deaths. Our census bureaus and other
departments have developed techniques which enable them to give us
complete, separate census lists and keep us informed daily as to the
exact number of our living population, their ages, and their full
requirements.</p>

<p>"By preparing careful and detailed budgets for all necessities with
generous allowances to cover all possible exigencies and by relying
upon our knowledge of regulated scientific cultivation of industrial
manufacturing concentration, of conservation and preservation, and
of nearly perfect and unwasteful arteries of transportation and
distribution, we have not only solved production and equalized
distribution, but we have also succeeded in overcoming and proving
your old law of supply and demand. A false principle founded mainly on
your artificial manipulation of cornering your markets, partly due to
your neglect of preparing and offsetting against potential calamitous
weather losses of crops and other commodities.</p>

<p>"In sciences and discoveries we are away far advanced of you Earthmen;
and with all that we only scratched the crust surface of nature's
infinite mysteries. Every once and a while we unravel new ones, making
marvelous improved changes in our mode of life. For those of us who
want an extended longevity our scientists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span> expect soon to disclose a
medium to lengthen our life span to 500 or 1000 years.</p>

<p>"You have made great progress in your sciences, chemistry, physics,
therapeutics, biology, mechanics, and others.</p>

<p>"You also made great strides in your political sciences, in doing
away with your titles, feudal lord systems, kings, and in your form
of government; but you greatly, and criminally retrogress in your
political economy.</p>

<p>"Your economic system looks to us to be on the same primitive level
as in the many large regions of your earth where farmers are still
scratching your earth surface with wooden plows, reap with the sickle,
thresh with hand flails, and where your modern methods of tillage,
irrigation, fertilizing, crop rotation, and seed selection are unknown
or not used.</p>

<p>"Your moneyism with its constant devaluations, foreign exchange panics,
oppressive custom duties, and tariffs on imports and exports, creating
economic disruption, with different standards of life, is one of the
main causes for the prevention of free trade and unity between your
nations. As a result you have your wars, booms, and panics, your
inflations and deflations, your prosperity and depressions, your
overproduction and underproduction, your progressions and stagnations.
Your abounding lands go to waste. Your lack of reclamation, drainage,
and irrigation, your unfertilized, overcultivated, overgrazed lands;
poverty, and famine among some of your nations with abundance in
others. Hunger, misery and sickness in some and great wealth, affluence
and plenty with others, within your same nation, city, street, block,
and even apartment houses, where an assistant janitor with his
family live in the basement in poverty. All without concrete plans,
regulations, restraints, and control; resulting in your confused and
chaotic economy.</p>

<p>"The perplexing languages, religions, customs and ideologies between
the people of your nations, are incentives to enmity, turmoil,
revolutions, and wars. Even now black clouds of dissensions and
differences in your ideologies are looming on your horizon, seriously
dividing the nations of your globe into two different camps and
menacing your world peace. Perhaps another terrible explosive world war
is in the offing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>"Our efforts have united us with our utmost zeal and devotion to
loftier ideals and higher principles, and is the fundamental force that
sustains, creates, constructs, and accelerates the continual perfection
of the elements necessary to our harmonious, contented and happy life.
All we have, all productions, possessions, or wealth, we create and
labor for from our lands, seas, and air resources, are owned for the
common use and free enjoyment of all of us, just as the air, sunlight,
and sunshine on Earth are for the common use of all your Earthmen.</p>

<p>"The mediums of profit or force to spur us to work harder are
non-existent. Our motto is solely to serve, and not to profit. One
hundred per cent of our working time, labor, energy and production is
solely and directly used and spent for our progress, construction,
sanitation, cure and prevention of diseases, pleasures, amusements, and
in all avenues to lengthen and make our lives more democratic in its
true, and full sense. We are more comfortable, healthier, safer, better
and happier. I dare say more than 90% of your working time, directly
and indirectly, is used for the creation of offensive, defensive,
destructive and killing instruments. Thank God that our teen age boys
do not have to army drill and train as they do on your high school
playgrounds and surrounding streets and we do not have to send them
into gory battles to either get killed or become paraplegics.</p>

<p>"We are of our own free will controlled to our way of life, and
have great potentiality of advancement, and attainment to an equal
realization of our aims.</p>

<p>"I hope I have proven to you that our way of what you call regimented
life is of our own choice and free will, and far superior and better
than yours. It gives us real liberty, freedom and happiness.</p>

<p>"Your gigantic bonded Federal public debts to the amount of
$252,292,247,513.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>"Burdened with payments on account of your many wars.</p>

<p>"Veterans administration reports that pensions and benefits are still
being paid yearly to veterans' heirs and dependents of war veterans,
as the aftermath of the Mexican War of 1846. The Civil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span> War of 1865.
Wars with the Indian tribes, war with Spain of 1898. World War 1 and 2
amount to $1,788,883,344.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>"These do not include your states, counties, cities and private
indebtedness with your extra load of interest payments on all of them.</p>

<p>"Regimented and enslaved economically by octopus monopolies created by
your moneyism.</p>

<p>"With different kinds of national dictatorial and corruptive
governments, with their organized forces of secret police, with
their innumerable disgraceful prisons, insane asylums, and horrible
concentration and slave working camps.</p>

<p>"Your compulsory military drafts, trainings, services, savage gory
battles, and extermination. Life on your planet is so very hazardous,
you have no safety.</p>

<p>"In general your sanitary systems are disgraceful. You criminally
expose your people to typhoid, dysentery, infantile paralysis, and
gastroenteritis from your sewer polluted drinking and bathing waters;
and with your poisonous drugs, alcohol, tobacco and other unhealthful
foods and habits.</p>

<p>"You are not by any means a free lance, from your economic struggles,
and you will never have democracy, as it is truly defined, as long as
you tolerate moneyism, but you love these conditions, and call that
freedom?"</p>

<p>The Congressman then interrupted, "Although I am convinced by what I
have seen, heard, and learned that the ways of life on your planet are
superior to ours, yet your system would not be constitutional in the
United States. An amendment to our constitution to conform to your ways
may not prove successful. Not only our members of Congress, but also
all members of our state legislatures would have to be persuaded that
your way of life is the best. It would be very hard to get them to
agree to your way of distributing the products of industry, for they
would say that impartial distribution of the difference of ability
among individuals in industry and earning capacity is unjust. They all
strictly believe in our system of private enterprise and ownership of
property."</p>

<p>Sun-Rank Banard answered, "I beg to correct them. We do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span> advocate
the equal distribution of the products of industry regardless of the
difference of ability, earning capacity, and deserved recompense
of the individual. On the contrary, we reward only the deserving,
intelligent, able individual worker and the real inventor or
discoverer. Only they merit the benefits from their work; however,
on Earth the industrialists, the entrepreneurs, and the financiers
wrongly receive most of the credit. Very seldom, and only by hard
struggles does your hard worker or your real inventor reap riches from
his endeavors, regardless of the ability, inventiveness, industry, and
earning capacity of your individual. It is the shrewd manipulator, the
promoter, the wealthy, who first take advantage of circumstances to
promote their own interests; who first seize, finance, and control your
most profitable and basic natural elements, or the most desirable and
lucrative enterprises, discoveries and inventions.</p>

<p>"On our planet the worker goes directly to our academy or laboratory
to submit his ideas, if they have any merits, he gets full cooperation
in working on them. There is no limit on the material, labor cost, and
resources that are expended to help the individual to put through and
perfect his ideas.</p>

<p>"No matter how small or large an article may be, if it proves a
hazardous or injurious one to any one of us, it is discarded. When
a dangerous invention or discovery seems necessary for our welfare,
our scientists can always improve upon it until all danger is removed
and is made safe. In that way the safety and well-being of us all is
promoted.</p>

<p>"The inventor is not only honorably advanced but handsomely
compensated; and he, his wife, during their life and his children,
until their voting age especially benefit from his work.</p>

<p>"There is a separate research laboratory for every activity and in
its many ramifications. In these large laboratories our experienced
scientists are constantly working on investigations, tests, and
researches for the advancement of mechanics, engineering, chemistry,
physics, atomics and medicine. Everyone on Mars benefits from their
improvements. We fully develop any invention or discovery even though
it may minimize or eliminate the usefulness of an already established
industry. We harness all our natural forces and elements which are
perpetual and useful—sun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span> rays, sea waves, river flows, waterfalls,
hot springs, etc.,—for our needs.</p>

<p>"We are not concerned about catering to and appeasing any special
interests. In discussing this point with one of you, he gave me the
following reference:"</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Natural Gas vs. John L. Lewis</span></p>

<p>It has now been more than a year since this column suggested that the
only way to counteract John L. Lewis was to convert our two war-built,
government-owned pipelines to natural gas. In the interim not a single
move toward conversion has been made. In the interim also millions of
cubic feet of Texas and Louisiana natural gas have gone up in smoke
and will never be recovered. Most people don't realize that this is
one of our most valuable natural resources. Nevertheless, much of it
is either burned up in Texas as waste gas, or allowed to escape. At
some Texas oil wells, a constant blaze is kept going, night and day,
in order to burn off surplus gas.</p>

<p>Reason for the government's failure to convert the Big Inch and
Little Inch pipelines to gas is not entirely red tape, nor the
secret opposition of John L. Lewis. Vigorously pulling wires to keep
the pipelines away from natural gas are the railroads and the coal
operators. They are Lewis' secret allies.</p>

<p>Illustrative of this wire-pulling is a natural gas pipeline only ten
miles from Washington, D.C., which brings gas from West Virginia.
Originally constructed to feed the nation's capital, the coal industry
and the railroads blocked the entrance of natural gas into Washington.
They were bringing in coal which the gas company then converted into
expensive artificial gas.</p>

<p>So for ten years West Virginia natural gas flowed to within sight of
the nation's capital but was never permitted to come into the city.
Only during the war was this finally changed. Now the West Virginia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
pipeline has been tapped, and Washington, at long last, is using cheap
natural gas.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>
</div>

<p>"I dare say that many of such natural resources, inventions, and
discoveries which would have endangered the existence of some of
your industries, must have been bought up and suppressed by the few
controlling them. All this babel by your economists to the effect
that your world cannot exist without money and that you would lose
your freedom, or live at a great cost of freedom—to all this I ask,
'What freedom?' Yes, your money systems would lose the freedom to
exploit you. It is none other than your economic system which is the
sole creative force causing your chaotic vortex to continuously rotate
around its money hub.</p>

<p>"Now coming back to your last question.</p>

<p>"You wanted to know what kind of a life system we had in the remote
past, and by what process we developed it to our present way of living?</p>

<p>"Our recorded history goes back to nearly 50 thousand years. We then
didn't as yet have our thought reading sixth sense, it developed in us
by a gradual, natural, and strong mind will process and evolution.</p>

<p>"Mind thought is a brain electrical wave effort. You Earth people
experience it between yourselves very often when you think and express
the same idea thought and expression between yourselves at the same
time.</p>

<p>"Proving that thought and mind transmission from one person to another
is in existence with you people, but only in a subconscious state. We
were then in the same condition as you earth people, a conglomeration
of tribes and nations with different languages, religions, and customs,
similar property ownership, money systems, and weaknesses.</p>

<p>"The intelligent ancestors of our different nations got together and
tried to find out ways and means to save themselves and their people
from their economic troubles. They found out that the major social
programs they wanted to inaugurate would be of prohibitive cost to each
nation.</p>

<p>"And to finance it would not only add a terrific financial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span> burden
increasing the cause of our ills. They arrived at a conception that
selfish, greedy, cruel, and evil human nature can only be changed,
improved, and perfected, by doing away with our pernicious systems then
in existence. To attain the object they started a most practical plan
to first entirely eradicate the main cause of their misfortunes, their
money systems. Their aim was to make a change, without causing a sudden
upheaval all over the planet. So they planned at first to make an
experimental test. They selected a large landed sparsely settled state
in one of our nations for the trial.</p>

<p>"Its national government then published a proclamation in that state
of its intentions to take effect on a certain date, with the promise
that its citizens would be indemnified if the experiment should prove
inoperative.</p>

<p>"It then started its preliminary function for the change. First, it
stored away for the inhabitants of that state provisions, such as
foods, medicines, clothes, furniture, furnishings and other necessities
for a one year supply, but excluding all poison habit forming
non-essential supplies.</p>

<p>"Ration books for all necessities were furnished to all of them.
Government guaranteed different ration books were also furnished them
whose points were good for interstate and international travels,
telephone, telegraph and post office communication.</p>

<p>"Then it devalued and took away all moneys, currency and negotiable
papers from their banks and citizens, and a law was passed in its
legislature that all mediums of money exchange, purchase and sales was
prohibited and unlawful, thus closing down all their banks, gambling
houses, breweries, distilleries, saloons, bars, liquor shops, and
all other non-productive and unethical industries. Distribution was
concentrated so that excess food markets, stores and factories were
also shut down. Everybody had to abandon non-productive labor, and
professions.</p>

<p>"The state administration took charge and supervision of all these
functions. All unemployed workers plus some of the former idlers were
advised to volunteer into productive occupations, industries and crafts.</p>

<p>"It was a most marvelous successful enterprising experiment of the age.
From a small populated state, with millions of unproductive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span> acres of
barren and brush lands, the inhabitants who were sustaining themselves
mostly from non-essential, and unethical industries, suddenly developed
into an extremely booming, progressive bee-hive, so that the drones
who were employed in non-productive occupations, with its idlers, the
former half of its population, and including a large influx of a great
many idlers from other states, were all feverishly working overtime at
its extensive productive projects in sanitation, housing, agriculture,
forestry, reclamation, public works and industrials.</p>

<p>"In an oversupply of labor, working hours were shortened and during
periods of undersupply, hours were lengthened. Overproductions were
shipped on a barter system to other states as an exchange for articles
that they didn't have.</p>

<p>"They were all to remain living in their present homes until new and
better standard of living quarters were built ready for their occupancy.</p>

<p>"They also voluntarily deposited with the government all their jewelry
for safe keeping, so they would not be able to use them for a medium of
exchange during the transformation.</p>

<p>"After a certain time the pattern of life of the citizens of this state
turned out to be a very workable plan. All were actively employed in
productive work and happy to know that they were doing it to reach and
realize a beneficial goal. Knowing the purpose, and importance of this
experiment, they tried in every way to make it successful.</p>

<p>"Even our wealthy gladly made sacrifices, and were happy to join and
know, that at last, they and their future generations would live in
peace, in comfort, in complete security, and without fear.</p>

<p>"Other states and nations soon started to join and emulate this system
until it was finally adopted by all of our nations. The metamorphosis,
from our former economic system, to our present one was smoothly
accomplished without any hitch. All Mars' nations then united and
entirely suppressed the political entity of every one of their nations,
merging all of them, even their religions and languages, into a single
one for the entire planet of Mars. Our old way of life was changed to
our present one by a gradual development. They put in execution the
following bill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span> of rights. We are to promote, defend and guard human
rights, dignity and safety of the person. We are to have full liberty
of political speech and assembly. We are to have equal rights, and
opportunities in our economic and political fields. We are to have an
equal standard of life with economic security (barring those of us of
higher degrees) without want, fear, privation, or exploitation. We
are to be provided with all our life's substances. We are to be free
from an oppressive government rule. Our aim is, and will be, continual
social progress and expansion for a higher standard of life. We are
to have the right of individual petition and appeal to the highest
government executive, council, and court of justice. We do not and will
not have race, and sex intolerance and discrimination.</p>

<p>"Our government continually and gradually put in operation constructive
plans and improvements.</p>

<p>"It took long years with constant changes to bring it up to our present
standard of life. We now celebrate 'Emancipation Day' every year to
commemorate that event. It's our most important holiday.</p>

<p>"Our two planets are nearly identical and men-inhabited, both are
greatly blessed by nature. We Martians by our combined efforts,
unselfish, and perfect living methods have helped in creating it into
a paradise. Whereas you Earthmen by your selfish, greedy, corruptive,
filthy, and cruel ways and systems of life are defiling its God-given
bounties.</p>

<p>"Life on your earth is a terrible ordeal, after a most devastating
world war with all its ills, your nations are in dispute, holding up
your world peace, over possessions, reparations, booty, loot, material
gains, imperialistic aims, different ideologies, and aggressive wars.
Within your nations there is a lack of social control, insecurity,
instability, at all times the unknown, unpredictable, chaotic
conditions, serious strikes, disputes and greed, constant mounting
cost of living, inflations, increasing taxations, all of which halt
reconversion, tend to bring on increasing armaments, aggressions, wars,
fear depressions, famine, and miseries among the population of your
Earth, endangering the existence of your nations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>"Your five big nations have made an effort through their United Nations
assembly to remedy some of these situations. But the plan is too new.
The policy has not been definitely determined. To date there has been a
great deal of talk but little action. Selfishness in your human nature
here again deeply asserts itself, fifty-five of your nations laid down
conditions against aggressions, but when it came to fight it, only a
few joined to help, and only with small military tokens.</p>

<p>"I believe for their own safety, that your powerful, and influential
leaders and people of your nation should get together without delay,
and initiate a movement to help your government to start a broad,
liberal and humane living system experiment similar to our way of
life, in one of its least inhabited state, territory, or island, and
broadcast the fact to all the peoples of your world.</p>

<p>"That test with the promise that should it prove successful it will
gradually adopt it for your whole nation. This should create a salutary
effect on the peoples of your earth to counteract and turn them against
the cruel and corrupt principles in existence, and advocated by some of
your dictatorship government nations."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>New Delhi, India, Dec. 26, 1950 (AP)—Prime Minister Nehru said today
the struggle between communism and democracy will be decided, not
on the field of battle. Nehru declared that in the final analysis
the people might discard both communism and democracy for some
"intermediary or other methods."</p>

<p>He added that the ultimate test lies, not in accumulation of a private
fortune, but in raising the standards of the people.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>
</div>

<p>"I leave it to your own good judgment to contrast our happy existence
with yours, where your moneyism causes and creates violent emotions and
convulsions in your political, social, economic, and religious life.</p>

<p>"It has impregnated in you an animal desire for selfish ownership,
greed and power, bringing on mass destruction and killing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span> between
you. Since time immemorial you have without restraint constantly
intensified, and developed them."</p>

<p>"You are infiltrated and surrounded by fanatic enemy zealots. When some
of your own government officials traitorously betray your top secrets
to enemy nations."</p>

<p>"You are now in a critical period. Constant fear and apprehension are
beclouding all of you on your earth and at great speed and violence you
propel yourself to extinction. You are all sitting on an inferno. Can't
you read the handwriting on the wall?"</p>

<p>"You hide your head in the sand, like an ostrich, and refuse to face
the facts. But your situation is serious enough that you should by all
means be aware of the disaster that may overtake you.</p>

<p>"You are now in an Asiatic hot war, it may soon develop into a
sizzling one. Before the holocaust breaks loose, you can still save
the world by proving to suffering humanity that you are starting a new
social-economic movement experiment, for it's benefit.</p>

<p>"A change on your earth to our way, is about due, must it come through
bloodshed?</p>

<p>"Different forms of governments, ideologies, and systems of life are
spreading like wildfire over your continents of Europe and Asia:
starting in it's wake your world's aggressions, and a terrific race for
all kinds of human destructive armaments.</p>

<p>"Inimical armies are facing each other, in close physical proximity;
don't you realize that at sometime a commander in his cups, may strike
a spark that will engulf your whole world in a conflagration? Must you
have a social upheaval and a human exterminating war before you realize
what's good for you?</p>

<p>"You have no other alternative, you must as soon as possible root
out and outlaw your money systems, or face continual ferocious armed
conflicts, and your eventual inevitable doom."</p>

<p>"In the event of another war, win or lose, you are bound to lose, if
your nation wins it will have a tremendous additional war cost burden;
if it loses, those left of you will be burdened with an oppressive
police regime with its consequent tortured confessions, purges, slavery
and fear.</p>

<p>"In spite of your apathy and blind pertinacious reluctance to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span> hearken
to logical counsel, evolution will ultimately save you. Inexorable
nature has a way of its own; as the fishes of your waters fight against
all strong currents and tides to reach their spawning grounds, and the
birds of your sky fight against storms and winds to reach their nesting
grounds, so will your humanity infallibly follow its natural dictates
and instincts to drive and overcome your false civilizations and all
your man-made seemingly invincible obstacles."</p>

<p>When Sun-Rank Banard concluded his lecture, it left all of us facing a
gloomy aspect, we were thoughtful for a few minutes. It took time for
his remarks to penetrate. One doesn't change one's ideas, learned since
childhood, in a few moments. But most of us realized the truth of his
remarks, and on the way out, our conversations with each other proved
that he had presented his points fairly convincingly and very logically.</p>

<p>We quickly made our farewells and prepared to depart. I shall long
remember my Martian friends, their sincere hospitality, and the delight
they took in offering their best to us. I hated to leave Lieutenant
Balmore. We had come a long way together since that chance meeting on
the park bench. I realized I might never see him again since it was his
and his crew's intentions to remain permanently on Mars.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><i>Nonproducers</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">After a very</span> friendly parting with all our friends, we embarked on the
Martian airship and were on our way to earth. We at once made a visit
to our own plane which we found in perfect condition.</p>

<p>We were speedily getting nearer to earth and of course, during these
two days we continually had very important conferences with Sun-Rank
Banard.</p>

<p>He prepared a friendly message of greeting from the Martians, to be
delivered to our President.</p>

<p>Forty-eight hours after a last friendly parting with the Martians we
embarked in our own plane and were cut loose from their ship. A few of
our veterans were experienced air pilots, who operated it.</p>

<p>Since some of them had to return to their hospitals on the west coast
for medical attention, Sun-Rank Banard agreed to let our plane out over
the stratosphere so that we could land on the west coast of the United
States.</p>

<p>It took us a little time to land at Hamilton Air Field. In the meantime
the Congressman wired our President of our safe arrival, and requested
an appointment so as to report to him all what happened to us, as well
as to deliver to him the Martian message.</p>

<p>The President then called for a full secret cabinet meeting, and
invited certain congressional leaders, as well as a few of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span> most
prominent scientists. He wired us to report and also to bring along
with us all of those who came back from the Martian trip.</p>

<p>We landed on our own planet and after our veterans were given their
medical treatments at the hospital, we all again re-embarked on a
flight to Washington for the President's engagement.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Finally the great day arrived. Foreign diplomats, United Nations
delegates, Supreme Court judges, party leaders, many others and
senators, congressmen, labor union presidents, industrialists—all were
cooling their heels in the lobby of the President's office, impatiently
waiting to see him. The appointments with some had been delayed for
more than three hours, and with others postponed, an unheard-of
occurrence.</p>

<p>It was a most important conference the President was having with a
few scientists, congressmen, and those of us who had returned from
Mars. Even the Washington columnists couldn't fathom what was going
on. Except to those who were attending the meeting it has been kept a
complete secret.</p>

<p>Here is what was taking place. After the Congressman delivered to the
President the Martian message and gave him a general report, one of the
companions, who recently served in the American army in Korea, began
giving the President his own account of the adventures and experiences
on the planet Mars, picturing the life of the Martians. He made an
appeal to the President as follows:</p>

<p>"Starting in the seventeenth century, the ancestors of the great
many living here, for numerous reasons left their home countries to
establish themselves in new lands. Then they had good opportunities
to emigrate to a newly discovered continent. Now, our earth has been
entirely explored and there are no more new lands to emigrate to,
except to the planet Mars, from which we just returned. We asked the
Martians to grant us the privilege of permanently remaining on their
planet, but they refused; first, they want us to clean our own house,
and second, they are chary of introducing other new problems to their
population.</p>

<p>"We would like to have you, if our plan meets with your approval,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span> to
ask congress to pass a law allocating to us four adjoining islands in
the temperate zone of the Pacific where we fought our battles, or in
some other territory, where we can colonize and experiment in living
under a different economic system, similar to the one on Mars.</p>

<p>"We are seeking a solution, a possible change of conditions, without
conflicts.</p>

<p>"At first, we would like to be helped by lend-lease from our government
through the veterans bureau as per the allotments of our bill of
rights. Then we would ask that the islands or territory be put under
the protection but not under the rule of our government. Our new
system of life may not prove to be 100% successful in a world where
existence is interdependent, but we believe that a start in this
direction should, within a reasonable length of time, show good
results. We may even have to operate for awhile by bartering our
products to obtain others from other parts of the earth. And of course
the intercommunication, and shipments from and to our islands, of post
offices, of telephone, telegraph, and even radio may have to be done
with foreign exchange, but it would be handled solely by our post
offices until gradually discontinued.</p>

<p>"These islands would be peopled by selected intelligent young families
of our four different races. Each race would live separately and
exclusively on its own island, but all would be federated under our
same constitution and laws. The pioneers would have to be in good
standing and of good mental and physical condition who are to start a
new way of life. We propose to carefully investigate and select each
applicant and try him out; if he proves to be willing, ambitious and
cooperative, he will become one of our citizens. If not, he will be
shipped back.</p>

<p>"These pioneers must include many of our disabled and crippled war
veterans of proven integrity, to occupy positions of government
administratives, and if capable, of faculty members in our new
universities and schools; so that the strong ones can work at
construction. No other people will be allowed to immigrate there, and
visitors will be limited to a certain number and for a definite length
of time.</p>

<p>"Upon landing on these islands, we would first need shelter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span> for both
ourselves and the domestic animals. We intend also to bring with us
prefabricated metal houses which may be easily and quickly erected.
These homes will be used by our first contingent and their domestic
animals. After that we propose to build them ourselves of stone and
concrete.</p>

<p>"It will be our irrevocable aim and principle to have absolutely
fire-proof living quarters for man and beast.</p>

<p>"It is our intention to leave our families here until we have developed
suitable shelters and conveniences for them. We propose to land in
groups, to start reclamation, to clear the land, to dry up marshes, to
survey and divide the islands into farming homestead tracts. We shall
plan homes for a population of sixty thousand on each island within a
few years.</p>

<p>"For those who prefer to live in communities or small towns, we have
preliminary plans for a Model City to accommodate a population of
about thirty thousand, to be located if possible across a river not
wider than 150 feet. Each family will get free, one of our constructed
furnished, air-conditioned and fireproofed homes. The houses will be
built so that additional bedrooms may easily be attached and furnished
with the latest mechanical and electrical fixtures and appliances.</p>

<p>"The house will be on a seventy-five foot (front) by one hundred
fifty-foot-plot, the front facing a twenty-foot deep lawn alongside a
six-foot concrete walk. Beyond the walk will be a forty-foot landscaped
parkway between rows of nicely pruned trees, with flower beds and a
children's playground. Opposite will be another concrete walk, lawn and
house, so that the houses will be ninety-two feet apart, with lawns
and flower beds also on the side of buildings. Block lengths will be
fifteen hundred feet, with a width of four hundred and forty-two feet.
There will be twenty houses on each side of a parkway in a block.</p>

<p>"In the rear of these houses there will be enough space for a small
garden patch, a small helicopter, airplane landing area, a small
fireproofed chicken coop, and a garage for a jeep station wagon. These
spaces will face a fifty-foot back street fenced on both sides and
sunken ten feet below the surface. The sunken back streets will be used
only for mobile traffic, with underpasses and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span> tunnels every two blocks
or three thousand feet apart for turning and reaching parallel streets.</p>

<p>"All sewer lines, gas lines, hot and cold water lines, telephone,
electric, and steam conduits will be located in these back or
alley streets, supplying utilities from the rear into the homes.
All automobile, bicycle, bus, truck, and horse traffic will not be
allowed on the surface. All pedestrians will be able to walk and cross
everywhere on the surface streets or parkways within the city limits,
with their eyes closed, in perfect safety.</p>

<p>"All deliveries will be made from the rear. Our motto will be utmost
safety. No one will obtain a driver's or a pilot's license before he
has been proven trustworthy; his training will be severe and his skill
thorough, before he is licensed. No leniency will be permitted in our
safety rulings. Speed travel will be strictly controlled.</p>

<p>"The city will be formed like a large square, with residential homes
on all four comers and sides. It will contain four zones, and each
zone will be divided into three districts. Each zone will have its own
hospital, churches, community houses, and schools. Within the exact
center along both sides of the river, we expect to locate our public
parks, artificial lakes and waterfalls; artistic bridges will span the
river at every street. There will be parks, where we will congregate
for rest and to hear our symphony orchestra, and facilities for all
city activities. All large buildings will have roof landing fields for
helicopters, with auto parking garages under their surface.</p>

<p>"Manufacturing, mechanical shops, plants for electrical and other
utilities, and all other craft shops will be located outside the city
limits.</p>

<p>"In our survey for a small city of thirty thousand, we find that for
the good care and health of our inhabitants we will make provisions
for at least one permanent hospital bed for fifty of our people, or
six hundred hospital beds for the city. At least six hundred medical
doctors, an equal number of nurses, one hundred fifty dentists, fifty
chiropodists, and fifty optometrists will be required in the city, and
additional ones will be needed by our rural population.</p>

<p>"In a western city of the same size, there are now only about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
forty-seven physicians, twenty-two dentists, four chiropodists, ten
optometrists, and but two hospitals with a total of two hundred beds in
both of them.</p>

<p>"We do not approve of the wantonly extravagant and wasteful methods
now used by owners of industrial and commercial enterprises, their
innumerable competitive undertakings in the same lines.</p>

<p>"We propose to considerably save on them by concentrating our
industries and not multiplying them in competition with each other. We
believe in the economy of large size establishments, saving us valuable
time, and abundance of material, and considerable labor.</p>

<p>"We propose to have four large markets, each to be located in the
center nearest its zone, and every one of us in our district will be
allowed only two specified days per week to do our shopping.</p>

<p>"There are to be two very large department stores. Two large pharmacies
will take care of prescriptions, and medicines. Two bakeries, five
cleaning and dyeing establishments, five laundries, two lumber
yards—all large establishments—and only five accountants and five
attorneys will be allowed. Milk and dairy products will be delivered to
homes. Theatres will have sufficient seating capacity so that everyone
can see two shows per week. We shall receive all necessary supplies
free but we will be restricted through our ration books.</p>

<p>"In contrast, consider in the Western city above mentioned of thirty
thousand population. There are one hundred and forty-one attorneys,
twenty-four accountants, twenty cleaning and dyeing establishments,
fifteen laundries, ten lumber yards, nineteen druggists, seven
department stores, eight bakeries, nine men's clothing stores,
fifteen dress shops, twelve shoe shops, and twelve furniture stores.
We no doubt will save a great deal in labor, handling, delivery, and
materials by concentrating our stores to the minimum, at the same time
provide a better service.</p>

<p>"At first we will do away entirely with the non-productive professions,
and occupations as well as considerably reduce the semi-productive
ones. We will create and increase necessary and productive callings so
that every one, including idlers and aged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span> (excepting the infirm) shall
always be employed. Let me explain what I mean by non-productive or
non-essential jobs.</p>

<p>"One of the fundamental causes of our troubles is that nearly
fifty percent of our young and vigorous active workers are doing
non-essential work; not only in unnecessary jobs but in the many
branches of necessary ones. We propose to do away with the unnecessary
jobs and concentrate on the needful ones, thus furthering our well
being and adding to the advantages of the requisite productive ones. I
will list herewith, in consecutive order, some of the non-productive,
non-essential, and dispensible jobs and service to which I have
reference.</p>

<p>"No. I—Non-productive services: We will have no use for a fire
department, fire escapes, fire alarm systems, fire insurance and fire
underwriters of all kinds; thus avoiding the services of firemen, labor
and materials of fire houses, fire trucks, and all supplies and labor
of fire insurance companies, while having complete safety in our waking
and sleeping hours.</p>

<p>"No. II—Since we are not going to own property directly or use money,
we will entirely dispense with innumerable non-productive services
connected with money. In these alone you can conjecture about how many
of those directly and indirectly employed can be shifted to productive
employments to great numbers of professions, crafts and trades running
into the hundreds.</p>

<p>"No. III—We are going to have one language on our islands. There is
a great waste of time, labor, energy, and materials in having so many
different languages on our earth.</p>

<p>"A universal language would doubtless save us more than the cost of all
our earth wars, and maybe it would help to keep them away.</p>

<p>"We will not need or use the economic waste to advertise or push any
product. All of us realize the enormous amount of time and energy
spent in advertising. It is not always the quality but most often the
publicity which sells a product. Much labor and materials are being
used and wasted in this boundless non-productive service.</p>

<p>"No. IV—We will have no gambling of any kind, or alcohol, dispensing
with gambling houses and devices, no breweries, distilleries, bars,
saloons, night clubs and their equipment and supplies.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span> In fact, we
will do away with all unethical, unprincipled, and immoral business and
their workers.</p>

<p>"I can give you a list three times as large, but I do not wish to take
up your valuable time.</p>

<p>"Can you roughly estimate the great percentage of our inhabitants that
are employed in all the above dispensible and non-productive wasteful
services? It must certainly be very large. The amount of materials used
and wasted is enormous. If all of them could be shifted into productive
labor and services and these materials used for the benefit of mankind,
what a beautiful world we would have."</p>

<p>The president asked, "What will you do with the excess workers that you
expect to save from all these side-line and unproductive employments?"</p>

<p>"Why there are hundreds of professions, crafts, and trades that need
them. We need a great many more doctors, dentists, nurses, architects,
engineers of all kinds, draftsmen, teachers, chemists, and all kinds
of laboratory research men, many reclamation and highway workers,
and workers in crafts and trades. We need a great many farmers, farm
laborers, farming implement makers, construction workers, concrete and
cement workers for homes, buildings, bridges, machine tool workers,
tinsmiths, iron and steel workers, electricians, telephone mechanics,
steamfitters, plumbers, airplane and parachute makers and mechanics,
railroad and transportation workers, roofers, radio, refrigeration
and air conditioning mechanics, fireproofing and insulation workers,
shoemakers, tailors, dressmakers, milliners, hat makers, and hundreds
of other workers that we can keep busy provided that we always try to
construct, improve, and expand, to produce and build, and to better the
conditions, convenience, and comfort of us all."</p>

<p>"Do I understand that you will obtain all this without paying for it
and that all of you will live on the same standard, regardless of
the better workmanship and ability of others of you?" The President
questioned, "And how will you compensate those of you who excel
in their endeavors, and others of you who may invent an important
mechanical improvement, discover the cure for a disease, or contrive
some chemical development which will save<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span> labor and materials. In
other words, what incentive will any of you have to excel?"</p>

<p>"I was expecting that question. First, as I have mentioned before,
every one of us will get our house, our food, and all of life's
necessities absolutely free; second, we will copy the system of the
Martians. We will have ten lower degrees and ten higher ones. The
higher ones we will call rank degrees. There will be ten points between
one degree and another and we will be gradually and honorably promoted
or demoted by points the same as we were in the army. Those who have
made a discovery, an invention or a needful improvement and those who
have done meritorious service will receive for life a better, larger,
and more comfortable home in the suburbs outside the city, with certain
luxuries such as a better and larger plane and luxurious pleasure
automobiles. They will have the services of attendants in their homes;
first production and best quality of all our necessities, and many
other compensations and honors that our authorities will decree. On the
other hand, we will demote and punish any one who, through malicious
intent, will not obey our laws and regulations or will not comport
himself honorably according to our rules.</p>

<p>"We and many others of our returned soldiers and sailors who have just
served and fought in the bloodiest of world battles, and we, with
our buddies, who sacrificed themselves on the battlefields, were the
instruments in this most atrocious war. The victims of inhuman hellish,
cruel warfare, we experienced and endured the ordeals of the greatest
sufferings that human flesh and fortitude can stand in battles.</p>

<p>"We fought on the blood-soaked decks and gun-turreted floors of
battleships, in the fuselage, cockpit, bellies, and wings of flying
fortresses, inside hot, cramped, fire-and-cannon belching tanks, in the
putrified trenches and shell and fox holes of battle scarred beaches,
on the sides of most inaccessible steep mountain precipices, and on
deserts and in jungles where we lay day and night in putrid mud, water,
and scum. We faced blinding, blazing sun, terrific heat, torrential
rains, and body-freezing snow blizzards. We suffered from frost bites,
lack of sleep, hunger, and thirst, surrounded by dirt and bitten by
insects, vermin, and reptiles during the agonies of our painful wounds.
We constantly heard the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span> anguishing, pleading and moaning of men
lying wounded on No Man's Land. Before our very eyes, our buddies and
brothers and best friends were shot and torn asunder. Others had their
eyes gouged out and hanging over their cheeks. Many of our paratroopers
were used as clay pigeons and by mistake shot down by our own soldiers.
At any moment we were expecting to meet their fate. Many of our buddies
were destroyed like a puff of smoke, whose only remains and memories
are the star medals worn by their mothers.</p>

<p>"We were like a pack of maddened wolves with the strength, daring, and
fearlessness of lunatics. With diabolical fury, we darted and bounded
wildly and fearlessly into No Man's Land in the face of the greatest
danger.</p>

<p>"Timid ones became heroes without knowing it. The weakest ones killed
with their bare hands. It was indescribable! All of us became filthy,
cruel, inhuman beasts, with fierce irrational emotions and the sole
urge to kill, kill, and kill our enemy. We fought to the death with no
quarter asked or given. Most of us were mumbling our prayers or the
names of our beloved. It is really a miracle that those of us who came
out alive from this vertex of blood and slaughter are again normal and
human.</p>

<p>"Closing his eyes, kneeling, passionately weeping, and vehemently
imploring, he exclaims—In my mind's eye I see passing in front of me,
the lost souls, images of dead soldiers, some of the countless billions
of them who died on the battlefields of our earth.</p>

<p>"Their spirits are joining and inspiring me in this solemn entreaty for
you to help us, so that their sacrifices shall not have been in vain.
Standing up, he continued:</p>

<p>"What of the great many of us who survived, but who are maimed,
crippled, invalidated, disfigured and shell shocked for life? The
terrible pictures of our battle sufferings recur to us very often
in our dreams. Through our torments, tortures, and ordeals, we have
learned in the hardest way the contributive whys and causes of wars and
inhumanity.</p>

<p>"Labor and capital struggles, strikes, unemployment, racial hatred,
and misery are becoming burdensome and unbearable to the majority of
us in this world. In our military life, in the army, in our company,
and on the battlefields, we lived unselfishly as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span> brothers and buddies.
We loved each other, judged each other on our merits, and forgave each
other our frailties and weaknesses.</p>

<p>"Now that we have re-entered civilian life, it is irksome to us to
adjust ourselves and face an existence of selfishness, where the main
object in life is personal interest, regardless of those others. Nature
has endowed us with intelligence; on account of it we are humane,
helpful, unselfish, and self-sacrificing for the welfare of our kind.
Our ancestors have planted on us a money system, a most heartless,
dangerous, tempting, criminally corrupting, degrading, and depraving
medium without which we cannot obtain our necessities.</p>

<p>"In the last war we who endured agonies were used as tools for gaining
victory in war for a <i>part</i> of humanity. <i>Now</i>, we are
anxious to be used as implements for gaining universal salvation
for <i>all</i> humanity. By our test and peaceful experiment which
we ask you to allow, we hope to exemplify the new order which will
achieve universal and lasting peace by destroying the real causes and
incentives for crime and for all cruel wars with its wanton disregard
of human life, and thereby save humanity.</p>

<p>"On our planet, in three successive progressive changes, with each
consecutive variation, we increased and intensified our armed war
conflict cruelties against each other.</p>

<p>"First, the stone age, then the iron age and now we have with us,
appalling atomic, gas and bacterial warfare. Help us to once and
for all make an end to them. 'Tempora mutantur, et nos mutamur in
illis'—The times are changed, and we are changed with them. You as the
head of a leading world nation by such an act, example, and pattern to
humanity, you will the sooner bring about the brotherhood of all men,
and world security. A showdown is getting nearer, help us to forestall
it.</p>

<p>"Please! Please! Mr. President, grant us these four islands for world
experimental stations and laboratories, now so indispensable. Let them
and us be the testing grounds and mediums in a new and better plan
and ways of human conduct, relationship, intercourse, culture, and an
economic system for the unlimited benefit of all mankind."</p>

<p>The President said, "I would suggest that you have our Congressmen here
with the one that visited Mars who has observed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span> their mode of life,
present a Bill to Congress so that it be passed. I will sign it, and
good luck to you!"</p>

<p>"We all hope that Congress will pass this Bill, and if our experiment
of improved new economic ideas prove satisfactory, adjoining islands
and peoples may join us, extending our influence. Then the United
States will gain world leadership, and other nations will imitate us.
Therefore you and Congress will gain eternal honor, and fame in history
and posterity, as the saviors of humanity, and the time may come, I
hope, when there will be a gradual peaceable absorption of all earth's
inhabitants to our way without undue pressure or strife that one world
government will come into being, and a new life and the emancipation of
all will bring happiness in '<i>Our Coming World</i>.'"</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>About two weeks after our return, a mysterious package attached to a
small parachute of a strange design and fabric was seen floating down
from the skies at La Guardia airfield. In it were found letters written
on strange paper, enclosed in unstamped matching envelopes. One of them
was addressed to me from Lieutenant Balmore; eleven other letters were
addressed to his and his crew members' parents.</p>

<p>There was also a portfolio crammed with money, jewelry, and papers.
Included were the last wills and testaments and transfer of properties
of the crew, appointing me as executor and providing directions for
turning over as soon as possible moneys and valuables and all their
earthly possessions to their respective families. In his letter
Lieutenant Balmore described his happy marriage with his beloved Xora,
as well as the marriages of his crew members with beautiful Martian
maidens of their choice, performed in one grand ceremony.</p>

<p>As another expression of his gratitude he writes: "Our opportune
acquaintance, with our trips to Mars, was a very auspicious event, not
only for us but with our efforts and your book a momentous opportunity
to promote the deliverance of my former fellow Earthmen. My crew
members join me in not only being very thankful, but also greatly
obligated for the sincere faith you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span> had in me, and it is due to your
wholehearted support, that we are now the happiest men in the universe."</p>

<p>He enclosed a copy of announcements of large front page headlines which
were in all Martian newspapers as follows:</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">A Red Letter Day on Mars</span>"</p>

<p>"Today took place the unprecedented, extraordinary occurrence marking
the beginning of a new and momentous era. Eleven Earth youths were
married to eleven of our maidens. These couples were joined in a grand
nuptial ceremony at one wedding attended by all the high dignitaries
of our planet."</p>
